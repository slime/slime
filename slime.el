;;; Commentary:

;; This minor mode extends Lisp-Mode with CMUCL-specific features.
;; The features can be summarised thusly:
;;
;;   Separate control channel (WIRE) for communication with CMUCL,
;;   similar to Hemlock. This is used to implement other features,
;;   rather than talking to the Lisp listener "in-band".
;;
;;   Associates compiler notes/warnings with sexps in the source
;;   buffer. The text of each compiler note is annotated on the
;;   appropriate sexp in the buffer and the sexp is visually
;;   highlighted. Commands exist for navigating between compiler
;;   notes.
;;
;;   Comforts familiar from ILISP: completion of symbols, automatic
;;   display of arglists in function calls, and TAGS-like definition
;;   finding.
;;
;; The goal is to make Emacs support CMU Common Lisp as well as it
;; supports Emacs Lisp. The strategy is to take maximum advantage of
;; all CMUCL features and hooks, portability be damned to hades.
;;
;; Compatibility with other Common Lisps is not a goal.
;;
;; Compatibility with GNU Emacs 20 and 21 and XEmacs 21 is a goal. It
;; is not achieved yet, but will be required for all public
;; releases. Meanwhile we support GNU Emacs 21.

The Superior Lisp Interaction Mode, Extended (minor-mode).

Compilation commands compile the current buffer's source file and
visually highlight any resulting compiler notes and warnings:
\\[slime-compile-and-load-file]	- Compile and load the current buffer's file.
\\[slime-compile-file]	- Compile (but not load) the current buffer's file.
\\[slime-compile-defun]	- Compile the top-level form at point.

Commands for visiting compiler notes:
\\[slime-next-note]	- Goto the next form with a compiler note.
\\[slime-previous-note]	- Goto the previous form with a compiler note.
\\[slime-remove-notes]	- Remove compiler-note annotations in buffer.

Finding definitions:
\\[slime-edit-fdefinition]	- Edit the definition of the function called at point.
\\[slime-pop-find-definition-stack]	- Pop the definition stack to go back from a definition.

Programming aids:
\\[slime-complete-symbol]	- Complete the Lisp symbol at point. (Also M-TAB.)
\\[slime-macroexpand-1]	- Macroexpand once.
\\[slime-macroexpand-all]	- Macroexpand all.

Documentation commands:
\\[slime-describe-symbol]:	Describe symbol.
\\[slime-apropos]:	Apropos search.
\\[slime-diassemble]: Disassemble a function.

Evaluation commands:
\\[slime-eval-defun]	- Evaluate top-level from containing point.
\\[slime-eval-last-expression]	- Evaluate sexp before point.
\\[slime-pprint-eval-list-expression]	- Evaluate sexp before point, pretty-print result.
