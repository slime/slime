Overview.
----------------------------------------

  SLIME is the Superior Lisp Interaction Mode for Emacs. It is
  implemented in two main parts: the Emacs Lisp side (slime.el), and
  the support library for the Common Lisp (swank.lisp and swank-*.lisp)

  For a real description, see the manual in doc/

Quick setup instructions
------------------------

  In Emacs Lisp:

    (add-to-list 'load-path "/the/path/to/this/directory")
    (require 'slime)
    (slime-setup)

  Make sure your `inferior-lisp-program' is set to a compatible
  version of Lisp.

  Use `M-x' slime to fire up and connect to an inferior Lisp.
  SLIME will now automatically be available in your Lisp source
  buffers.

Licence.
----------------------------------------

  SLIME is free software. The source files are licensed separately for
  maximum compatibility with their host environment, for example
  slime.el is GPL and swank-cmucl.lisp is public domain. See the
  source files for more details.
