Commands to compile the current buffer's source file and visually
highlight any resulting compiler notes and warnings:
\\[slime-compile-and-load-file]	- Compile and load the current buffer's file.
\\[slime-compile-file]	- Compile (but not load) the current buffer's file.
\\[slime-compile-defun]	- Compile the top-level form at point.

Commands for visiting compiler notes:
\\[slime-next-note]	- Goto the next form with a compiler note.
\\[slime-previous-note]	- Goto the previous form with a compiler note.
\\[slime-remove-notes]	- Remove compiler-note annotations in buffer.

Finding definitions:
\\[slime-edit-definition]
- Edit the definition of the function called at point.
\\[slime-pop-find-definition-stack]
- Pop the definition stack to go back from a definition.

Documentation commands:
\\[slime-describe-symbol]	- Describe symbol.
\\[slime-apropos]	- Apropos search.
\\[slime-disassemble-symbol]	- Disassemble a function.

Evaluation commands:
\\[slime-eval-defun]	- Evaluate top-level from containing point.
\\[slime-eval-last-expression]	- Evaluate sexp before point.
\\[slime-pprint-eval-last-expression]	- Evaluate sexp before point, pretty-print result.

Full set of commands:
\\{slime-mode-map}

This is a minor mode.  If called interactively, toggle the `Slime mode'
mode.  If the prefix argument is positive, enable the mode, and if it is
zero or negative, disable the mode.

If called from Lisp, toggle the mode if ARG is `toggle'.  Enable the
mode if ARG is nil, omitted, or is a positive number.  Disable the mode
if ARG is a negative number.

To check whether the minor mode is enabled in the current buffer,
evaluate the variable `slime-mode'.

The mode's hook is called both when the mode is enabled and when it is
disabled.
