2005-05-04  Edi Weitz  <edi@agharta.de>

	* swank-lispworks.lisp (call-with-compilation-hooks): Provide
	better implementation.
	(compile-file-and-collect-notes): Advice for COMPILE-FILE so
	pathname information for undefined functions can be recorded.

2005-05-03  Luke Gorrie  <luke@synap.se>

	* swank.lisp (slime-secret): Removed #+unix conditional, suggested
	by Edi Weitz.

2005-05-02  Mark Wooding  <mdw@nsict.org>

	sends the contents (as a password) during initial handshaking.
	(announce-server-port): Use :IF-EXISTS :ERROR to prevent bad guys
	from slipping a symlink into /tmp and reading what port Lisp is
	listening on.

	won't break.
	(slime-browser-map): New variable. Add support for the common 'q'
	keystroke to quit out of the xref.
	(slime-fetch-browsable-xrefs): New function. Remove the (FLET ...)
	entries which appear on at least CMUCL.  I don't believe you can
	actually expand them on any current implementation and they just
	mess up the browse tree.  Use only the method name when looking
	up (METHOD ...) entries on CMUCL.  This really shouldn't be here,
	but I can't see how to avoid the error thrown by swank:xref.
	(slime-expand-xrefs): Use it.
	(slime-call-with-browser-setup): Initialize slime-buffer-package
	properly.  Previously, lisp-mode was called after setting it, but

2005-04-20  Luke Gorrie  <luke@synap.se>

	* swank.lisp (arglist-to-string): Bind *PRINT-ESCAPE* to NIL. This
	way symbols in arglists are printed as with PRINC, i.e. without
	package qualifier.

	* swank-sbcl.lisp (preferred-communication-style): Use
	`linux_no_threads_p' alien variable to decide whether to use

2005-04-09  Helmut Eller  <heller@common-lisp.net>

	* slime.el (sldb-get-buffer): Create a fresh buffer if there's no
	buffer for the connection (and don't reuse an existing buffer even
	if it has a matching name).
	(slime-buffer-visible-p, slime-ir1-expand): Delete unused
	functions.  Mark some others as unused, but leave them there
	because they are potentially useful.

	* swank.lisp (with-io-redirection, with-connection)
	(with-buffer-syntax): Implement macros with `call-with' functions
	to avoid some code bloat.
	(call-with-connection, maybe-call-with-io-redirection)

	(eval-string-in-frame, pprint-eval-string-in-frame): Use it.

	* swank-allegro.lisp (eval-in-frame): Allegro's
	eval-form-in-context does nothing special with lexical variables
	in the frame.  Wrap an explicit LET around the form to get similar
	behavior as in the other Lisps.
	(inspect-for-emacs (structure-object)): Remove structure related
	methods.  It's already covered by the general case with
	allegro-inspect.
	(common-seperated-spec): Deleted

2005-04-01  Luke Gorrie  <luke@synap.se>

	* slime.el (slime-xref-mode): Summarise the most important
	bindings in the mode description.

	* metering.lisp: Now supports only CLISP and OpenMCL.
	Removed a lot of really ugly reader-conditionalized code, much of

	* swank-source-path-parser.lisp (check-source-path): Signal an
	error if a source path is malformed. SBCL sometimes gives (NIL).

	sys::program-id doesn't exist.

2005-03-23  Marco Baringer  <mb@bese.it>

	* swank.lisp (commit-edited-value): Read a backquated string,
	instead of quating the result of read. This allows one to put

	action for symbols.

	* swank-source-file-cache.lisp (read-snippet): Skip comments and
	whitespace in SBCL. The source-positions reported by SBCL are not

	have posted to sbcl-devel.

	* swank-source-file-cache.lisp: Factored this into its own file,
	from swank-cmucl.lisp.

	(extra-keywords): Return a secondary value (allow-other-keys).
	For make-instance, try to finalize the class if it is not
	finalized yet (fix for Allegro CL 6.2).  If class is not
	finalizable, use direct slots instead of slots and indicate that
	the keywords are not complete.
	(enrich-decoded-arglist-with-extra-keywords): New function, use
	the secondary value of extra-keywords.
	(arglist-for-insertion, complete-form): Use it here.

	* swank-lispworks.lisp (compute-applicable-methods-using-classes):
	Implement it.

2005-02-20  Matthias Koeppe  <mkoeppe@mail.math.uni-magdeburg.de>

	Supersede the command slime-insert-arglist with the new command
	slime-complete-form and bind it to C-c C-s.  The command completes
	an incomplete form with a template for the missing arguments.
	There is special code for discovering extra keywords of generic
	functions and for handling make-instance. Examples:

	  (subseq "abc" <C-c C-s>
	    --inserts--> start [end])
	  (find 17 <C-c C-s>
	    --inserts--> sequence :from-end from-end :test test
	                 :test-not test-not :start start :end end :key key)
	  (find 17 '(17 18 19) :test #'= <C-c C-s>
	    --inserts--> :from-end from-end
	                 :test-not test-not :start start :end end :key key)
	  (defclass foo () ((bar :initarg :bar)))
	  (defmethod initialize-instance :after ((object foo) &key blub))
	  (make-instance 'foo <C-c C-s>
	    --inserts--> :bar bar :blub blub initargs...)
	
	* swank.lisp (arglist): New struct for storing decoded arglists.

	slime-insert-arglist.
	
2005-02-18  Antonio Menezes Leitao  <aml@gia.ist.utl.pt>

	Improve the trace mechanism (on lisps that support it). SLIME is
	now able to trace/untrace flet/labels functions, methods and, of
	course, regular and generic functions.

	In the process support for sending code to emacs form the lisp was
	added. The code, elisp forms, is sent over the wire like normal
	lisp code, evaluated in emacs and the return value is returned
	back to the lisp.

	* slime.el (slime-dispatch-event): Added the :evaluale-in-emacs
	dispatch state which simply parses the message and class
	evaluate-in-emacs.
	(evaluate-in-emacs): New function.
	(complete-name-context-at-point, name-context-at-point, out-first,
	definition-name, parameter-specializers,

	functions implementing the new intelligent slime trace.

	toggle-trace-generic-function-methods, toggle-trace-method,
	toggle-trace-fdefinition-wherein,
	toggle-trace-fdefinition-within): New backend functions
	for the new trace facility.

	* swank.lisp (dispatch-event): Handle the :evaluate-in-emacs
	message type.
	(evaluate-in-emacs): New function.

	* swank-allegro.lisp (toggle-trace-generic-function-methods,
	toggle-trace, toggle-trace-function, toggle-trace-method,
	toggle-trace-fdefinition-wherein,
	toggle-trace-fdefinition-within): Implement.
	(process-fspec-for-allegro): New function.
	
	* swank-cmucl.lisp (toggle-trace-generic-function-methods,
	toggle-trace-function, toggle-trace-method,
	toggle-trace-fdefinition-wherein): Implement.	
	(toggle-trace, process-fspec): New functions.

	* slime.el: Require the timer package explicitly.

2005-02-02  Luke Gorrie  <luke@synap.se>

	* slime.el (slime-repl-send-input): Move some properties
	of old REPL input (e.g. read-only) from text properties into an
	overlay, so that kill/yank will leave them behind. Left
	`slime-repl-old-input' as a text properties because it's more
	convenient to lookup that way.
	(slime-repl-return): Ignore `slime-repl-old-input' property if the
	point is in front of the current REPL prompt, i.e. if the user has
	copy&pasted some old REPL input into the current input area.

2005-01-30  Bryan O'Connor <bryan-slime@lunch.org>

	* slime.el (slime-goto-location-position): Changed the regexp to
	require the function-name to be followed by a
	non-symbol-constituent character \S_.  Previously, a function-name
	of "find" first matched find-if-not if it occured earlier in the
	file.

2005-01-27  Helmut Eller  <heller@common-lisp.net>

	* slime.el (slime-busy-p): Ignore debugged continuations to enable

	new variable *pending-continuations* and include the list of
	active continuations in the debugger info for Emacs.
	(eval-and-grab-output): New function.  Used by slime-eval-print.
	(*log-output*): Renamed from *log-io*.  Use *standard-error* as
	initial value instead of *terminal-io*.  CMUCL opens its own tty
	and that makes it hard to redirect to output with a shell.
	*standard-error* writes its output to file descriptor 2.
	(*canonical-package-nicknames*): Fix typo.

2005-01-20  Helmut Eller  <heller@common-lisp.net>

	* swank.lisp (parse-symbol): Don't break if the package doesn't
	exist.  Reported by Lynn Quam.

	* swank-cmucl.lisp (breakpoint): Add a slot for return values to
	make return values inspectable in the debugger.

2005-01-19  Matthias Koeppe <mkoeppe@merkur.math.uni-magdeburg.de>

	* slime.el (slime-insert-arglist): Inserts a template for a
	function call instead of the plain arglist; this makes a
	difference for functions with optional and keyword arguments.

	* swank.lisp (arglist-to-template-string): New function.
	(arglist-for-insertion): Use it
	(decode-keyword-arg, decode-optional-arg): New functions.

	* slime.el (slime-header-line-p): Customize variable to
	enable/disable the header-line in the REPL.

2005-01-18  Luke Gorrie  <luke@synap.se>

	* slime.el (slime-complete-symbol*-fancy): New variable to enable
	extra bells and whistles with slime-complete-symbol*. Currently
	controls whether to use arglists semantically. Default is t.
	(slime-complete-symbol*-fancy-bit): Factored out this function.
	Only do "semantic" completion when the symbol is in
	function-position, avoid interning argument names in Emacs, and
	don't display arglists if the minibuffer is active.

2005-01-14  Luke Gorrie  <luke@synap.se>

	* slime.el (slime-repl-send-input): Make old input read-only using
	an overlay instead of a text property. This way if you copy&paste
	the input elsewhere it will become editable (overlay is associated
	with the buffer region and not the text).

2005-01-14  Edi Weitz  <edi@agharta.de>

        * slime.el (slime-complete-symbol*): Maybe insert closing
        parenthesis or space (depending on arglist) after symbol
        completion has finished.  Optionally also show arglist.

2005-01-13  Helmut Eller  <heller@common-lisp.net>

	* swank-cmucl.lisp (create-socket): The byte-order of the :host
	argument for CREATE-INET-LISTENER was changed in the Jan 2005
	snapshot.  Test whether the symbol 'ext:socket-error exists to
	decide if we are in a older version.
	(resolve-hostname): Return the address in host byte-order.

2005-01-12  Robert Lehr <bozzio@the-lehrs.com>

	initialize dynamic variables in worker threads.
	(spawn-worker-thread, call-with-bindings): New helper functions.

2005-01-10  Eduardo Muñoz <emufer@terra.es>

	* swank.lisp (inspect-for-emacs-list): LispWorks has a low args
	limit for apply: use reduce instead of apply.

2005-01-10  Helmut Eller  <heller@common-lisp.net>

	* slime.el (slime-conservative-indentation): The default is now
	nil.  Suggested by Travis Cross.

	comint-completion-addsuffix so unambiguous or exact completion
	closes the string automatically.

2004-12-16  Matthias Koeppe <mkoeppe@merkur.math.uni-magdeburg.de>

	* slime.el (slime-keys): Bind M-* to
	slime-pop-find-definition-stack for compatibility with standard
	Emacs conventions.

2004-12-16  Helmut Eller  <heller@common-lisp.net>

	* swank-source-path-parser.lisp (read-source-form): New function
	which uses *read-suppress* properly.  Common code from
	source-path-stream-position and form-number-stream-position.
	(source-path-stream-position): Use it.

	read-source-form.

	* swank.lisp (frame-for-emacs): Print the frame number a little
	nicer with ~2D.

	* swank-cmucl.lisp, swank-backend.lisp (frame-package): Delete it.
	Include the package name for local variables because it is utterly
	confusing if `eval-in-frame' doesn't work due to missing package
	prefixes.
	
	* swank-source-path-parser.lisp (source-path-stream-position):
	Bind *read-suppress* to nil before calling
	read-and-record-source-map.

	unwanted inf-lisp bindings in lisp-mode-map.
	(slime-load-file): Handle (buffer-file-name) being nil.

2004-11-20  Helmut Eller  <heller@common-lisp.net>

	* swank-sbcl.lisp (thread-status): Decode the thread-state-slot
	instead of returning ???.

	* swank-allegro.lisp (swank-mop:slot-definition-documentation):
	ACL 7 says documentation should have 2 args. So, pass t as second
	argument.
	(fspec-primary-name): Recurse until we have a symbol.
	(allegro-inspect): New function.  Mostly reverse engineered from
	ACL's native inspector.
	(inspect-for-emacs (t), inspect-for-emacs (function)): Use it.

	* swank.lisp (inspect-for-emacs array): Use row-major-aref instead
	of a displaced array.  I hope that does the same.
	(inspect-for-emacs integer): Ignore errors in
	decode-universal-time.  Negative values and, in SBCL, also small

	with fill-pointers.

2004-11-15  Helmut Eller  <heller@common-lisp.net>

	* slime.el: The REPL commands ,quit and ,sayoonara are now
	distinct.  Previously Quit killed all Lisps an all buffers.  The
	new Quit command kills only the current Lisp.
	(slime-quit-lisp): New function.
	(repl-command quit): Use it. Don't delete all buffers.
	(repl-command sayoonara): No longer an alias for ,quit.

	Provide better defaults for Emacsen which don't support :inherited
	faces.

	* swank-backend.lisp (emacs-connected): Don't pass the stream as
	argument.  make-stream-interactive is a better place for setting
	buffering options.

	* swank-cmucl.lisp (emacs-connected): Install GC hooks to display
	GC messages in the echo area.
	(sos/misc :flush-output): There seem to be funny signal safety
	issues if the dedicated output stream is not used.  So, lets first
	reset the buffer index before sending the buffer to the underlying
	stream.

	* swank-lispworks.lisp (frame-source-location-for-emacs): Pass the
	function name of the next (newer) frame as a hint to Emacs.  This
	way we can highlight the call site in some cases, instead of the
	entire defun.

	argument is now a dspec, not only a name. Also include hints for
	Emacs.
	(lispworks-inspect): Simplified from old code.

	(emacs-connected, make-stream-interactive): Move the

	(inspect-for-emacs): Remove (declare (ignore)) for inexistent
	variable inspection-mode. Added T qualifiers in method arguments.

	* swank-openmcl.lisp (inspect-for-emacs): Use definterface so
	SLIME knows we implement this.

	objects under lisp datums.
	
2004-11-09  Helmut Eller  <heller@common-lisp.net>

	* swank.lisp (features-for-emacs): New function to avoid
	keyword/string confusion.  Case doesn't matter since Emacs will
	downcase them anyway.
	(connection-info, sync-features-to-emacs): Use it.  Should fix
	highlighting bug reported by Edi Weitz.

	* slime.el (slime-eval-feature-conditional): Convert AND, OR, and
	NOT to lowercase keywords.
	(slime-net-read3): Silly optimization: give char-after the offset
	as argument to avoid save-excursion and forward-char.

2004-11-07  Brian Downing  <bdowning@lavos.net>

	* slime.el (slime-fuzzy-explanation): Added line to describe
	flags (:boundp, :fboundp, :macro, etc), which are now reported in

	* swank-source-path-parser.lisp (source-path-stream-position):
	Bind *read-suppress* only as long as we skip over forms.  The last
	toplevel form in the path is read with *read-suppress* = nil
	because in newer versions of CMUCL and SBCL read will return nil
	if *read-suppress* is t.

2004-10-28  Helmut Eller  <heller@common-lisp.net>

	* swank-clisp.lisp: Ups. Undo previous change.

	* swank-clisp.lisp: Add workaround for CLISP's broken control
	string parser.

	* swank-cmucl.lisp (set-step-breakpoints): Handle breakpoints at

	tried to set a breakpoint at the current position and consequently
	was only hit during the next call.
	(inspect-for-emacs)[function]: Call the next method only for
	funcallable instances.
	(profile-report, profile-reset, unprofile-all): We have to use
	eval because the macro expansion depends on the value of
	*timed-functions*.  Reported by Chisheng Huang.

	* slime.el (slime-space): Call slime-message in the right buffer,
	so that after-command hooks are added in the right buffer.
	Reported by Juho Snellman.

	(sldb-step): Moved to the front end.
	(inspector-princ, method-specializers-for-inspect): Simplified.
	(methods-by-applicability): Use a simpler algorithm. I doubt there
	is much difference in practice.
	(inspect-for-emacs)[symbol, function, standard-generic-function]
	[standard-method]: Use less than 80 columns.
	(inspector-call-nth-action): Don't accept &rest args.  Was never
	used.

	nil to avoid confusion for people who don't care about the issue.

	* swank-sbcl.lisp (signal-compiler-condition): Remove reader
	conditionals as the current code doesn't work in any SBCL before
	0.8.13 anyway.

	* swank-source-path-parser.lisp: Remove workarounds for SBCL bugs.
	The bugs are fixed in the versions we support.

	* swank-cmucl.lisp (read-error-location)
	(signal-compiler-condition): Handle read-errors.
	(swank-compile-file): Don't load the fasl file if there was an
	error.

	properly.
	(*sldb-pprint-dispatch*): Initialize it with the default dispatch
	table.

	* slime.el (slime-init-command): New function to send the command
	to load swank.  Having a separate function for the task should
	make it easier to start a Lips with a preloaded swank.
	(slime-maybe-start-lisp): Use it.
	(slime-maybe-start-multiprocessing): Deleted.
	(slime-repl-buffer): Include the name of the implementation.

2004-10-25  Thomas Schilling <tjs_ng@yahoo.de>

	* swank-allegro.lisp (inspect-for-emacs): Use

	(slime-maybe-start-lisp): Take the command and buffer as argument.
	Decide here whether we should start start a new processwe or just

	return stuff like (:operator ...); try to handle it.

	lambdas which have usually a string as name, like "defun foo".

	handle escaped |symbols| correctly.

	buffer after we know Lisp's pid.  Print the words of encouragement
	here, when all the other asynchronous initialization is completed.

	swank-openmcl.lisp, swank-sbcl.lisp (swank-mop): Export
	eql-specializer, eql-specializer-object and
	specializer-direct-methods from swank-mop.

	* swank-cmucl.lisp (inspect-for-emacs): Thinko fix.

	* swank-lispworks.lisp (swank-mop): Export
	specializer-direct-methods.
	(eql-specializer): Implement.
	(eql-specializer-object): Implement.

	* swank-sbcl.lisp (inspect-for-emacs): Fix broken ignore
	declaration.

	* doc/slime.texi: Update inspector documentation.
	
2004-09-16  Marco Baringer  <mb@bese.it>

	* swank-clisp.lisp (swank-mop, inspect-for-emacs): Only define the
	CLOS parts of the inspector if the underlying lisp provides the
	required functionality. If not enough MOP is present to implement
	the inspector then we define some very simple replacement methods.

2004-09-16  Marco Baringer  <mb@bese.it>

	* swank-clisp.lisp (swank-mop): Implement the MOP compatability
	package.
	(inspect-for-emacs): Update for new inspection API.

2004-09-15  Alan Ruttenberg <alanr-l@mumble.net>
	* swank-openmcl: typo in who-references. Fix frame-var-value

2004-09-15  Marco Baringer  <mb@bese.it>

	* slime.el (slime-inspector-label-face,
	slime-inspector-value-face, slime-inspector-action-face,
	slime-inspector-type-face): These faces now inherit from similar
	font-lock-<whatever> faces.
	(slime-open-inspector): Use slime-inspector-value-face for values.

	* swank.lisp (inspect-for-emacs): Add function and compiler-macro
	documentation when inspecting symbols. View the truename of
	logical pathnames where they exist. Fix typos in package
	inspector (fix by Torsten Poulin <torsten@diku.dk>).

	* swank-sbcl.lisp, swank-cmucl.lisp (inspect-for-emacs): Insert
	function object's documentation when it's available.
	
2004-09-15  Eduardo Muñoz  <emufer@terra.es> 

	* .cvsignore: Added *.elc

	* hyperspec.el: Fixed syntax error.

2004-09-15  Alan Caulkins <fatman@maxint.net>

	* swank.lisp (cleanp-connection-threads): Kill all Swank threads
	for a connection when it terminates.

2004-09-14  Thomas Schilling <tjs_ng@yahoo.de>

	* swank-allegro.lisp (inspect-for-emacs): Fixes to previous patch.

2004-09-14  Marco Baringer  <mb@bese.it>

	* swank-backend.lisp (inspector, make-default-inspector): Add an
	INSPECTOR object argument to the inspector protocol. This allows
	implementations to provide more information regarding cretain
	objects which can't be, or simply aren't, inspected using the
	generic inspector implementation. also export inspect-for-emacs
	and related symbols from the backend package.
	(make-default-inspector): New function.
	
	* swank.lisp (inspected-parts): Rename to inspect-for-emacs and
	add an inspector argument. Move inspect-for-emacs to
	swank-backend.lisp, leave only the default implementations.

	* swank-openml.lisp, swank-sbcl.lisp, swank-allegro.lisp,
	swank-cmucl.lisp, swank-lispworks.lisp (inspected-parts): Rename
	and change argument list. Many of the inspected-parts methods were
	being clobbered by the inspected-parts in swank.lisp, now that
	they're being used the return values have been updated for the new
	inspect-for-emacs API.
	
2004-09-14  Thomas Schilling <tjs_ng@yahoo.de>

	* swank-allegro.lisp (inspected-parts): Implement inspector for
	structs.

2004-09-13  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* swank.lisp (intern-catch-tag): New function.
	(read-user-input-from-emacs, take-input): Use it.

2004-09-13  John Paul Wallington  <jpw@gnu.org>

	* swank.lisp (define-special): Make the doc-type `variable'
	rather than `symbol'.  Don't quote `doc'.  Doc fix.

2004-09-09  Martin Simmons <martin@xanalys.com>

	* swank-lispworks.lisp: Set up the swank-mop package.  Implement
 	swank-mop:slot-definition-documentation and function-name.

2004-09-13  Marco Baringer  <mb@bese.it>

	* swank.lisp (inspected-parts): Added inspectors for pathnames,
	logical pathnames, standard-objects and numbers (float, ratio,
	integer and complex).

	* swank-backend.lisp: Define import-to-swank-mop.

	* swank-openmcl.lisp, swank-sbcl.lisp, swank-allegro.lisp: Don't
	define the import-to-swank-mop function (now defined in
	swank-backend.lisp).

	* swank-cmucl.lisp (swank-mop, function-name): Implement backend
	for inspector.
	(arglist): Add support for extracting arglists from function
	objects.
	(create-socket): Don't specify the host on PPC.

2004-09-13  Alan Ruttenberg <alanr-l@mumble.net>

        * slime.el slime-goto-location-position: New location specifiers:
	(:method name specializers . qualifiers) all are strings. Looks
	for defxxx name then the qualifiers as words, in order then the
	specializers as words, in order (except for "T", which is
	optional). Pass the symbols names for specializers and qualifiers 
	(no packages). Used by openmcl but might be useful for others
	(:text-anchored <position fixnum> <string> <delta fixnum>) 
	Got to position, then search for string, then move delta. To
	support upcoming source recording for openmcl debugging.

	* swank-openmcl multiple changes: - fix support for *sldb-top*
	 (formerly *swank-debugger-stack-frame*) Was not thread safe. Now
	 (application-error), and (interrupt-thread) records the error
	 pointer in a table associated with thread and map-backtrace picks
	 up the appropriate pointer. *process-to-stack-top*,
	(grab-stack-top), (record-stack-top).

  	 - Other adjustments for changes to multiprocessing: remove
	(force-break-in-listener) no longer necessary since we use
	process-interrupt instead of ccl::*interactive-abort-process*
	Adjust break-in-sldb to do so for swank repl connections
	(abstraction breaking reference to swank::*connections*, but
	nicely via intern)

	 - changes to (find-definitions) (function-source-location),
	 addition of (maybe-method-location) (remove-filename-quoting).  To support
	editing definitions of methods. To fix bug with pathnames with
	quoted characters (like "\\.swank.lisp"). To remove bogus source
	recording of l1-boot-3 in functions that didn't have a source file
	noted.

	 - Implementation of xref functions: (xref-locations) uses xref
	implementation added to openmcl recently. Note that you have to
	(ccl::start-xref) for it to work for other than who-calls, and
	that xref information is not currently persisted in fasl files (I
	will release a patch for this soon) Backend functions (who-binds)
	(who-macroexpands) (who-references) (who-sets)
	(who-calls) (list-callees) (who-specializes)
	
  	 - Lifted profile backend functions from swank-clisp which use
	 "metering.lisp"

	 - (openmcl-set-debug-switches) turns on the various variables I.
	know about that have the lisp record extra debugging
	information(including starting xref). I suggest you call
	it. Should it be called by default?

	- (frame-arguments) use builtin ccl::frame-supplied-args since the
	current version was sometimes missing the first argument to the
	function. (I think this was when it was passed by register. If you
	don't want to lose it in the frame locals in backtrace, call
	(openmcl-set-debug-switches) specifically, set
	ccl::*ppc2-compiler-register-save-label* to t

	- implement frame-var-value backend

	* metering.lisp: Minor changes to #+ #- to recognize openmcl

	* swank-loader.lisp: Load "metering.lisp"
		
2004-09-13  Marco Baringer  <mb@bese.it>

	* swank.lisp (inspected-parts): Deal with unfinalized classes in
	standard-class inspector. (Patch from Thomas Schilling)

2004-09-13  Marco Baringer  <mb@bese.it>

	* swank.lisp: New inspector protocol. The lisp side now returns a
	specially formated list of "things" to format which are then
	passed to emacs and rendered in the inspector buffer. Things can
	be either text, recursivly inspectable values, or functions to
	call.
	(inspected-parts): Redefine for new inspector protocol.
	(*inspectee-parts*): Redefine as array.
	(*inspectee-actions*): New array, similar to *inspectee-parts*.
	(reset-inspector): Update for new implementation of
	*inspectee-parts* and new variable *inspectee-actions*.
	(inspector-contents-for-emacs): New function.
	(inspect-object): Update for new inspector protocol.
	(inspector-nth-part): Update for new *inspectee-parts*
	implementation.
	(inspector-call-nth-action): New function.

	* slime.el (slime-inspector-action-face): New face.
	(slime-open-inspector): Adapt to new inspector protocol.
	(slime-inspector-operate-on-point): New function, subsumes
	slime-inspector-inspect-object-at-point.
	(slime-inspector-next-inspectable-object): Skip to next object,
	not just end of current object; wrap around buffer.
	(slime-inspector-mode-map): change bindings of [return] and "\C-m"

	* swank-bacend.lisp (swank-mop): New package. Simply defines all
	the MOP related symbols we need from an implementation.
	(arglist): Update doc string. Provide default implementation.
	(function-name): New backend function.
	
	* swank-allegro.lisp (swank-mop, slot-definition-documentation):
	Implement. (Patch from Thomas Schilling)

	* swank-sbcl.lisp (swank-mop, slot-definition-documentation,
	function-name): Implement.

	* swank-openmcl.lisp (swank-mop, function-name): Implement.
	(arglist): Implement for function objects.

2004-09-12  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* swank.lisp (compile-file-for-emacs): Use with-buffer-syntax so
	that SBCL source files can be compiled.  From Christophe Rhodes.

2004-09-09  Martin Simmons <martin@xanalys.com>

	* swank-loader.lisp (make-swank-pathname): Preserve the host
	component (important for LispWorks on Windows).

2004-09-08  Martin Simmons <martin@xanalys.com>

	* swank-lispworks.lisp: Implement call-with-compilation-hooks.

2004-09-03  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* NEWS: Summarize changes since August.

	* slime.el: Add some docstrings.

	* mkdist.sh: Add PROBLEMS file. We're no longer alpha.

	* swank.lisp: Remove debugging code in comment.

	* swank-sbcl.lisp: Delete dead code.

	* swank-lispworks.lisp (defimplementation): define-dspec-alias
	seems to more apropriate than define-form-parser.

	* swank-cmucl.lisp (print-frame): Catch errors during printing.

	* README: Fix typo.

2004-09-02  Wolfgang Mederle <wolfgang.mederle@stud.uni-muenchen.de>

	* swank-loader.lisp (*lisp-name*): Replace / with - in CMUCL
	version strings.

2004-09-01  John Paul Wallington  <jpw@gnu.org>

	* slime.el (slime-oneliner): Don't use free variable.
	(slime-recenter-window, slime-set-connection-info)
	(slime-pprint-event, slime-compiler-notes-quit)
	(slime-apropos-summary): Likewise.
	(slime-connect): Tidy up handshake `message' call.

2004-09-01  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* slime.el (slime-repl-push-directory): Fix interactive spec.
	(sldb-reference-properties): Take a the reference object as
	argument instead of its parts. Fix callers accordingly.
	(slime-fuzzy-choices-buffer): Remove assignment to unused variable
	slime-fuzzy-target-mtime.
	(slime-ed): Replace call to new-frame with make-frame.
	(sldb-find-buffer): Cleanup.
	(sldb-highlight-sexp): Fix regexp. It's now almost a full line.

	* swank.lisp (completion-set, tokenize-symbol-designator)
	(tokenize-completion, fuzzy-completion-set)
	(briefly-describe-symbol-for-emacs): Remove simple-base-string
	declarations.

2004-08-30  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* PROBLEMS: We require SBCL 0.8.13.  0.8.12 is no longer
	supported.

	* swank-allegro.lisp (find-fspec-location): Catch errors in
	excl:source-file.

	* swank.lisp (send-to-socket-io): Add some ignore declarations.

	* slime.el (sldb-fetch-all-frames, sldb-end-of-backtrace)
	(sldb-beginning-of-backtrace): New commands.
	(slime-search-suppressed-forms): Change the start regexp so that
	reader conditionals in single line comments, like "; #+foo", are
	ignored.

2004-08-27  Peter Seibel  <peter@javamonkey.com>

	* swank-backend.lisp (swank-compile-string): Add directory
	argument which is used by Allegro backend to improve source
	recording for definitions compiled with C-c C-c.
 
2004-08-23  John Paul Wallington  <jpw@gnu.org>

	* slime.el (slime-pretty-package-name): Fix last cond clause.

2004-08-21  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* swank.lisp (*global-debugger*): New configurable to globally
	install swank-debugger-hook as *debugger-hook*. True by default.

2004-08-19  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* doc/slime.texi: C-c C-c C-a, C-c C-u C-e.
	Thanks Barry Fishman for reporting incorrect indexing.

2004-08-18  Matthew Danish <mrd+nospam@cmu.edu>

	* swank-allegro.lisp (swank-compile-string): Use #\; instead of
	#\: to separate the position from the buffer-name.  This avoids
	troubles on Windows.

2004-08-16  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* doc/slime.texi: Random updates.

	* slime.el (slime-space): Use slime-message instead of
	slime-background-message. This displays multi-line arglists.
	(sldb-mode-map): Bind 'C' to sldb-inspect-condition.

2004-08-14  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* slime.el (slime-find-buffer-package): Use "%s", not "%S", to
	avoid ugly escape characters, if the package name contains dots.

2004-08-13  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el (sldb-eval-in-frame): Print result to the REPL when a
	prefix argument is given.
	Added pull-down menus for SLDB and the REPL.

	* swank-source-path-parser.lisp: Removed caching of readtables and
	the source-map hashtable. Fresh creation is ultra-cheap (<1ms).
	The caching didn't handle modifications to readtables and
	generally made me feel uneasy while tracking down an obscure bug
	in a reader macro.
	The cached source-map hashtable also wasn't thread-safe (ho hum).

2004-08-13  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* slime.el (slime-merge-notes, slime-tree-for-note): Use the short
	note message for annotation in the source buffer and the long
	message in the tree widget.  Used to be the other way around.
	(sldb-insert-frames): Set the `start-open' property for XEmacs.
	Without `start-open', the `point-entered' property is inherited
	when we insert something before the "--more--" marker.  Reported
	by Sundar Narasimhan.

	* swank.lisp (variable-desc-for-echo-area): Bind some printer
	variables to limit the length of the output.

2004-08-05  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el (slime-setup): Added typeout-frame keyword argument.
	(slime-thread-attach): Fixed misnamed function call.

2004-08-04  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* swank-allegro.lisp (find-fspec-location): Fixed to work for more
	types of definition than just functions. So M-. now works for e.g.
	classes in Allegro. From Matthew Danish.
	(find-fspec-location): Include the type of the definition in the
	designator sent to Emacs. From Matthew Danish.

2004-08-04  Martin Simmons <martin@xanalys.com>

	* swank-lispworks.lisp (frame-actual-args): Correct syntax for
	handler-case.

2004-08-04  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* slime.el: (slime-mode-map, slime-repl-mode-map)
	(slime-repl-read-mode-map): Remove the binding for C-c C-g.  C-c
	C-b is now the default interrupt key.
	(slime-list-repl-short-cuts): Don't trash the shortcut-table: copy
	it before sorting.  (Thanks to Mark Simpson.)

2004-08-02  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el (slime-connect): Shorten the welcome message by leaving
	out the port number (which is displayed in the REPL anyway). This
	avoids line-wrapping some messages of encouragement.

	* swank.lisp (with-buffer-syntax): Don't bind *readtable* to
	*buffer-readtable* if they are already EQ. When we shadow this
	binding the user can't assign *readtable* from the REPL so it's
	best avoided when possible.

	* swank-allegro.lisp: Removed fwrapper-based code for inheriting
	"swankiness" to newly spawned threads. This was fighting the
	system and not the right thing.

	* slime.el (slime-choose-overlay-region): Tweaked the
	multiline-annotation-avoidance code to work with forms not
	starting with an open-paren, e.g. `(..) or #'(..).
	(slime-update-modeline-package): New configurable. Non-nil (the
	default) means update the Lisp package in the modeline using an
	idle timer.
	(slime-repl-send-input): Make the `slime-repl-old-input' property
	cover the whole input (including newline) so that pressing RET on
	the end of an input line works.
	Use a unique integer as the value of this property to distinguish
	adjacent inputs.
	(slime-current-package): Deal with narrowing.

2004-08-01  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* swank-allegro.lisp (swank-compile-string): Use a temporary file
	and set excl::*source-pathname* manually.  This way we can find
	the source buffer of functions compiled with C-c C-c.
	(call-with-temp-file, compile-from-temp-file): New functions.
	(list-callers, function-callers, in-constants-p)
	(map-function-constants): Implements list callers by groveling
	through the constants pools of named functions.

	* swank-lispworks.lisp: Minor refactoring.

2004-07-30  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* slime.el (slime-connection): Say "No default connection
	selected" if there are open connections but no default connection.
	(slime-tree-indent-item): Point wasn't updated correctly if the
	last line was empty.  Use insert-before-markers instead of insert
	to do it properly.
	(slime-draw-connection-list): Don't break if there is no default
	connection.

	* swank-cmucl.lisp (call-with-debugging-environment): Only handle
	DI::UNHANDLED-CONDITION not all DI:DEBUG-CONDITIONs.

	* swank-backend.lisp (sldb-condition): Show the original condition
	in the message.

2004-07-28  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* slime.el (slime-eval-feature-conditional): Treat uppercase
	operators NOT, AND, OR correctly.
	(sldb-find-buffer): Remove killed buffers.
	(sldb-quit): Raise an error if the RPC returns.
	(slime-expected-failures): Delete unused function.
	(complete-symbol): Test completion of
	swank::compile-file. LispWorks has extra completions for
	cl::compile-file.
	(arglist): Test arglist of method cl:class-name.  Add enough
	regexpery to pass the test in most implementations.

	* swank-sbcl.lisp (list-callers, list-callees): Implemented.

2004-07-26  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el (slime-first-change-hook): Add `save-match-data' to
	avoid breaking e.g. query-replace. Also added `save-excursion'
	just to be safe.

	* README: s/setup-slime/slime-setup/ in the .emacs snippet.

2004-07-23  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el (slime-set-state): Show the message in the modeline in
	the case where we aren't connected. Otherwise the "not connected"
	status is ignored.
	(slime-net-sentinel): Close the connection before changing the
	status message. The old behaviour of this combined with the old
	behaviour of `slime-set-state' could generally cause spurious
	errors after a connection was closed.

2004-07-22  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* swank.lisp (carefully-find-package): Return *BUFFER-PACKAGE* if
	no other package can be found. This is reverting a previous change
	that broke completion in buffers with no known package.

	* slime.el (slime-maybe-start-lisp): Check that *inferior-lisp*
	exists /and/ has a running process. Fixes a startup problem if
	your inferior-lisp has died and you want to restart SLIME.

2004-07-21  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el (slime-sync-package-and-default-directory): Sync
	`default-directory' in the REPL buffer too.
	(slime-set-state): Convenience function for setting a connection's
	state-name and updating the modeline if appropriate. This function
	is called in the right places.
	(slime-to-lisp-filename): Use `expand-file-name'.

2004-07-20  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el (slime-repl-update-banner): Restore old behaviour of
	using an asynchronous evaluation to setup the REPL. This works
	around a problem I'd reintroduced where the first REPL command
	uses the wrong keymap.

2004-07-20  Andreas Fuchs  <asf@boinkor.net>

	* swank-sbcl.lisp (call-with-compilation-hooks): Trap and report
	errors that cause compilation to fail, e.g. read errors.

2004-07-19  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* HACKING: Updated. Some notes about Emacs features.

	* slime.el: More major refactoring.
	Restructured and documented the networking and protocol code.
	(slime-rex-continuations): Now connection-local.

2004-07-18  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el: Major refactoring.
	Mostly resectioning and reordering definitions to try and improve
	readability.
	(slime-get-temp-buffer-create): New utility function to popup a
	temporary buffer that automatically has a binding on `q' to
	intelligently restore window configuration. Handy, but currently
	not applicable to all of our temporary buffers.
	(slime-with-chosen-connection): Removed this macro. Consequently
	the compilation commands no longer prompt for which connection to
	use when given a prefix argument. `slime-switch-to-output-buffer'
	still works like that, but for other cases I think the
	connection-list buffer is sufficient.
	(slime-eval-async): New arglist: (form &optional cont pkg). If the
	continuation is unspecified then the evaluation result is ignored,
	and if the package is unspecified then (slime-buffer-package) is
	used.
	(slime-eval): Package arg now defaults to (slime-buffer-package).
	(slime-current-package): New name for (slime-buffer-package). No
	more caching: returns the buffer-local `slime-buffer-package' if
	set, otherwise searches for an `in-package' form.
	A consequence of non-caching is that the package name doesn't
	appear in the modeline anymore. The simplification is worthwhile
	in my opinion.

2004-07-17  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el (slime-autodoc): If there is a global variable name at
	point then show its value.
	(slime-autodoc-cache-type): Cache type 'full is no longer
	supported.
	(slime-background-message): Truncate messages to fit on a single
	echo area line.
	(slime-repl-update-banner-p, slime-dont-prompt)
	(slime-swank-connection-retries): Removed these unused or unuseful
	configuration variables.
	Rearranged organised "customize" groups.

	* swank.lisp (variable-desc-for-echo-area): New function.
	(arglist-for-echo-area): Return nil if symbol can't be found.
	(close-connection): Close connection before printing error
	message. This avoids it getting lost in closed I/O redirection.

	* README, doc/slime.texi: Updated setup instructions.

2004-07-16  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el (slime-conservative-indentation): New variable. When
	true (the default) don't auto-learn indentation of def* and with-*
	macros. Set to nil if you want to learn them.
	(slime-handle-indentation-update): Use it.

	* swank.lisp (known-to-emacs-p): Removed filtering of def* and
	with-*. Now handled by Emacs.

	* slime.el (slime-interactive-eval): Changed display of results.
	By default the result goes to `slime-message', which leads either
	to echo area, temporary buffer, or typeout frame.
	With a prefix argument the result is printed to the REPL.
	This goes for all commands based on slime-interactive-eval, e.g.
	`C-x C-e' and `C-c M-:'.

2004-07-16  Peter Seibel  <peter@javamonkey.com>

	* slime.el (package-updating): Fixing this and other tests I broke
	with my change to how emacs keeps track of the package prompt
	string.
	(arglist): Fix an test failure under Allegro due to a slight
	difference in the way EXCL:ARGLIST returns arglist (no default
	values of &optional parameters)

2004-07-16  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* swank.lisp (print-connection): print-function for connection
	objects. Dumping the indentation-cache was damned ugly with
	non-truncated lines (e.g. bug reports on slime-devel).

	* slime.el (slime-setup): New function for installing a
	lisp-mode-hook. You can call this from ~/.emacs to setup SLIME.
	Takes a `autodoc' keyword argument to enable
	slime-autodoc-mode. We can add more keywords in future.
	(slime-keys): Moved `slime-reindent-defun' from C-M-q to
	C-cM-q. This avoids overriding the standard binding of C-M-q to
	index-sexp.
	(slime-typeout-frame-properties): Removed some properties:
	`name', because it interacts badly with X properties, `left' and
	`top' because they don't put the frame anywhere terribly
	convenient, and (width . 40) because it makes the frame narrower
	than the usual word-wrapping width.

2004-07-14  Peter Seibel  <peter@javamonkey.com>

	* slime.el (slime-lisp-package-prompt-string): Separate SLIME's
	notion of package into two parts, an actual package name and the
	name used in the prompt since the latter isn't necessarily an
	actual package nickname any more.

2004-07-13  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el (slime-restart-inferior-lisp): Renamed shortcut to
	"restart-inferior-lisp" from "restart-lisp". The name better
	suggests what it does: kill *inferior-lisp* and rerun SLIME.

2004-07-13  Eric Blood  <eblood@winkywooster.org>

	(slime-inspector-next-inspectable-object): New inspector command
	to goto the next inspectable object (slot). Bound to TAB.

2004-07-13  Christophe Rhodes  <csr21@cam.ac.uk>

	* slime.el: add support for actionable references in the
	*slime-compiler-notes* buffer.
	(slime-merge-notes): merge references if applicable.
	(slime-compiler-notes-mode-map): use new functions defaulting to
	show-details, but overrideable by text properties.
	(slime-tree-default-printer): destroy generality by assuming a
	tree of conditions, and insert references if applicable.
	(sldb-format-reference-source): add :amop
	
	* swank-sbcl.lisp (signal-compiler-condition,
	brief-compiler-message-for-emacs,
	long-compiler-message-for-emacs): handle references in compiler
	conditions.

	* swank.lisp (make-compiler-note): propagate references.

	* swank-backend.lisp (compiler-condition): add references slot.
	
2004-07-12  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el (slime-easy-menu): Added "Apropos all" menu item.
	(slime-restart-lisp): Added `restart-lisp' shortcut. Doesn't do
	the right thing if you have multiple Lisps up.

	* swank.lisp: Added some docstrings.
	Rearranged completion code and somewhat SLDB trying to layout
	functions above their subfunctions in a tree-like way.
	(slime-protocol-error): Renamed from slime-read-error.
	(carefully-find-package): Now returns NIL if package can't be
	determined, rather than *BUFFER-PACKAGE*. Correct? I didn't see
	why it should return *BUFFER-PACKAGE*.
	(xref): Find symbol in *BUFFER-PACKAGE*.

2004-07-09  Peter Seibel  <peter@javamonkey.com>

	* swank.lisp (package-string-for-prompt): Change the way package
	name in prompt is computed. N.B. after this change the name
	displayed will not necsarily be either an actual name or nickname
	of the package: if the name contains dots by default the prompt
	will only display the last element, i.e. COM.GIGAMONKEYS.SPAM will
	be shown as SPAM. This change also makes CL-USER the canonical
	name for COMMON-LISP-USER even in implementations that provide a
	shorter nickname such as USER.

2004-07-09  Christophe Rhodes  <csr21@cam.ac.uk>

	* slime.el (sldb-lookup-reference): substitute hyphens for spaces
	in the url.

2004-07-07  Thomas Schilling  <tjs_ng@yahoo.de>

	* swank.lisp (arglist-for-insertion): Changed formatting to use
	arglist-to-string. That results in proper cases for
	slime-insert-arglist.

2004-07-07  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* swank-loader.lisp (*lisp-name*): Include the version number in
	ACL.

	* slime.el (slime-alistify): Preserve order. This keeps the
	*compiler-notes* right. Pointed out by Christophe Rhodes.
	(slime-repl-update-banner-p): Renamed from slime-reply-..
	(slime-changelog-date): Reintroduced for informational purposes.
	(slime-repl-update-banner): Show ChangeLog date in the animation.
	(slime-space): Do arglist lookup before inserting the
	space. Otherwise we get a funky race condition: entering the space
	may trigger `first-change-hook', which would send an async
	notification to Lisp, which would put us in the 'busy' state and
	thus we wouldn't lookup the arglist! Detective work by Edi Weitz.
	(sldb-prune-initial-frames): More regexp fudgery :-(.
	(read-directory-name): Use `file-name-as-directory' to ensure we
	have the trailing / on the directory name.
	(byte-compile-warnings): Bye-compile slime-alistify. Its inputs
	can be pretty big.

2004-07-04  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el, swank-backend.lisp, swank.lisp: Added a new backend
	function `buffer-first-change' which is called via Emacs's
	`first-change-hook' in slime-mode buffers. This gives Lisp a
	chance to do something with source files before you change them on
	disk.

	* swank-cmucl.lisp (buffer-first-change): Suck the source file
	into the cache unless already present. This is for M-. to increase
	the chances of our having a copy of the sources corresponding with
	the loaded code. Should help with the case where a user edits and
	saves a file (without recompiling it) and then M-.'s for one of
	its definitions.

	* swank-allegro.lisp (make-process/inherit): Changed reader
	conditionals to use fwrappers for #+(version>= 6).

	* swank-backend.lisp (make-stream-interactive): This backend
	function is called with each stream that will be used for
	user-interaction, i.e. the redirected stdio streams. Can be used
	to setup special output-flushing or similar.

	* swank.lisp (open-streams): Call make-stream-interactive on the
	redirected io streams.

	* swank-allegro.lisp (make-stream-interactive): Set
	interactive-stream-p slot on the stream to make it auto-flush.
	(*swank-thread*, *inherited-bindings*): New variables.
	(spawn): Bind *swank-thread* to T.
	(make-process/inherit): Fwrapper (advice) for
	mp:make-process. When *swank-thread* is T then make the new thread
	inherit "sliminess": debugger hook, I/O streams, and also
	*swank-thread* so that its children will inherit too.

2004-07-03  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* hyperspec.el (common-lisp-hyperspec-section-4.0): Bugfix from
	Lennart Staflin.

	* slime.el (slime-repl-clear-output): Avoid clearing the previous
	REPL expression too. Patch from Andras Simon.

	* swank-backend.lisp (definterface): Don't use
	NO-APPLICABLE-METHOD for default methods. Instead just define them
	as regular methods with all argument types being
	T. Defimplementation will then replace them by using the same
	signature. N-A-M was a stupid idea!

2004-07-02  Brian Downing  <bdowning@lavos.net>

	* slime.el (slime-reindent-defun): Added a check for (boundp
	'slime-repl-input-start-mark) before checking the variable, as
	XEmacs leaves variables unbound when `make-variable-buffer-local'
	is run, while GNU Emacs binds them to NIL.

2004-07-02  Martin Simmons <martin@xanalys.com>

	* swank-lispworks.lisp (dspec-stream-position,
	make-dspec-location): Fix typo in features for LW 4.1 and 4.2.

2004-07-01  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* swank-lispworks.lisp (frame-actual-args): Bind
	*break-on-signals* to nil and special case &rest, &optional, and
	&key.

2004-07-01  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el (sldb-lookup-reference): Preserve case in SBCL node
	names. Previously they were downcased, but the HTML manual's
	filenames seem to have changed.

	* NEWS: Added security note about the TCP server.
	Added notes for ACL and ABCL.

	* doc/slime.texi: General updatings for an alpha release.

2004-06-30  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* slime.el (slime-display-compilation-output): New customizable
	variable.

	* swank.lisp: Minor cleanups.
	(find-symbol-designator, find-symbol-or-lose)
	(case-convert-input): Deleted.  Replaced with calls to
	parse-symbol{-or-lose}.

	* swank-lispworks.lisp (describe-symbol-for-emacs): Include
	information about setf-functions.
	(emacs-connected): Add a default method to
	env-internals:environment-display-debugger.

2004-06-30  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el (slime-read-port-and-connect-to-running-swank)
	(slime-connect, slime-open-stream-to-lisp): Replace "localhost"
	with "127.0.0.1". This is believed to avoid unwanted DNS lookups
	on certain operating systems. The lookups can become crippling if
	the DNS server isn't available.
	(line-beginning-position, line-end-position): Simple bugfix
	suggested by Richard Klinda.

	* swank-sbcl.lisp (preferred-communication-style): Choose
	:fd-handler instead of :sigio when threads aren't available. A lot
	of people seem to have had problems with :sigio on SBCL.

2004-06-30  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* NEWS: Wrote preliminary release notes for alpha-1.

2004-06-29  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* mkdist.sh: New shell script for creating a tarball for
	distribution.

2004-06-29  Bill Clementson  <Bill_Clementson@peoplesoft.com>

	* slime.el (slime-who-map): Add extra bindings for the XREF
	commands as with the documentation commands. Now `C-c C-w C-c' is
	`slime-who-calls' in addition to `C-c C-w c', etc.

2004-06-29  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el (sldb-prune-initial-frames): Tweaked regexp for
	matching SWANK's own stack frames for effectiveness in SBCL.
	(slime-keys): Shadow remaining inf-lisp keys (C-c C-a, C-c C-v)
	with a null `slime-nop' command until we put them to a real use.

	* swank.lisp (open-streams): Renamed the restart around reads from
	the user-input stream from ABORT to ABORT-READ. Invoking this
	restart seems kinda dangerous, so better for 'a' in SLDB not to do
	so.

2004-06-28  Thomas F. Burdick  <tfb@OCF.Berkeley.EDU>

	* swank.lisp (inspector-nth-part):
	* slime.el (slime-inspector-copy-down, slime-inspector-mode-map):
	Added copy-down command (M-RET) to easily move an object from the
	inspector to the repl.

2004-06-28  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el (slime-doc-map): New keymap for documentation
	commands. These all use the `C-c C-d' prefix, followed by:
	  a - apropos
	  p - apropos-package
	  z - apropos-all
	  d - describe-symbol
	  f - describe-function
	  h - hyperspec lookup
	  ~ - hyperspec lookup of a format character
	The final keystroke is bound both unmodified and with control, so
	both `C-c C-d a' and `C-c C-d C-a' will make an apropos
	search. The exception is hyperspec-lookup, because it's nice to
	leave C-h unbound so that `C-c C-d C-h' will summarise the
	documentation bindings.

2004-06-28  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* swank-allegro.lisp (nth-frame): Skip frames where
	frame-visible-p is false.

	* slime.el (slime-buffer-package): Return the cached package if we
	can't find something more sensible; this reverts a previous
	change.  The Lisp side will now fall back to an existing package
	if the one supplied by Emacs doesn't exist.  Using the cached
	version is also necessary for some commands in the apropos buffer.
	(sldb-insert-frame): Set the default-action property; pressing RET
	on frame lines now shows/hides details.
	(sldb-toggle-details): Preserve the current column.
	(slime-inspector-buffer, slime-saved-window-config)
	(slime-inspector-quit): Save and restore the window configuration.
	(slime-highlight-suppressed-forms, slime-search-suppressed-forms):
	Display expressions with reader conditionals (#+/#-) in
	font-lock-comment-face if the test is false.  Not implemented for
	XEmacs.
	(repl-return): New test.

2004-06-28  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el: Events in the *slime-events* buffer are now exact
	on-the-wire messages, without including e.g. Elisp continuation
	functions. This is easier for debugging I think.

	* swank-allegro.lisp (compute-backtrace): Only include frames
	satisfying `debugger:frame-visible-p'. I did this as a lame
	workaround for a problem where `output-frame' was segfaulting on
	certain frames, and those frames happened not to be visible-p. I
	don't know if it really fixes anything.

	* hyperspec.el (common-lisp-hyperspec-format): This command now
	works at the end of the buffer, fixed `char-after' usage as
	suggested by Johan Bockgård.

2004-06-28  Christophe Rhodes  <csr21@cam.ac.uk>

	* hyperspec.el: add support for issue cross-reference lookups,
	strongly inspired by hyperspec symbol lookup.
	(common-lisp-hyperspec-issuex-table,
	common-lisp-hyperspec-issuex-symbols): new variables
	(common-lisp-issuex): new function

	* slime.el (sldb-format-reference-node, sldb-lookup-reference):
	(sldb-reference-properties): use new support for issue lookups
	to support :ansi-cl :issue reference types.

	* hyperspec.el: add support for glossary lookups.
	(common-lisp-glossary-fun): new variable
	(common-lisp-glossary-4.0, common-lisp-glossary-6.0): new functions
	
	* slime.el (sldb-format-reference-node, sldb-lookup-reference):
	(sldb-reference-properties): use new support for glossary lookupts
	to support :ansi-cl :glossary reference types.

2004-06-27  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* doc/slime.texi: Remove macros from chapter and section headings
	to avoid texi2pdf breakage.

	* swank-source-path-parser.lisp (cmucl-style-get-macro-character):
	Add tests for #\space and #\\.  Suggested by Christophe Rhodes.

	* swank-sbcl.lisp, swank-openmcl.lisp, swank-lispworks.lisp,
	swank-cmucl.lisp, swank-backend.lisp, swank-allegro.lisp,
	swank-abcl.lisp (thread-id, find-thread): New backend functions.

	* swank.lisp (dispatch-event): Quitting from the debugger was
	seriously broken.  Fix it.  Move generation of thread ids to the
	backends.
	(encode-message, send-to-socket-io): Use WITHOUT-INTERRUPTS in
	send-to-socket-io.  The multithreaded version of encode-message
	doesn't need it.
	(nth-thread): Renamed from lookup-thread-by-id.
	(debug-nth-thread): Renamed from debug-thread-by-id:
	(kill-nth-thread): Renamed from kill-thread-by-id.

	* slime.el (sldb-get-buffer): Add support for sldb buffers for
	multiple threads.

2004-06-25  Thomas F. Burdick  <tfb@OCF.Berkeley.EDU>

	* swank-sbcl.lisp (call-with-syntax-hooks, with-debootstrapping):
	Preserve compatability with fairly recent SBCLs by checking for
	the presense of the debootstrapping facilities at macroexpansion
	time.

	* slime.el (sldb-insert-condition): Initialize sldb-default-action
	so that pressing RET inspects the condition.
	
2004-06-25  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* slime.el (slime-repl-insert-prompt): Set defun-prompt-regexp.
	beginning-of-defun can be very slow in the repl buffer if the
	defun-prompt-regexp is not set.
	(sldb-insert-locals): Initialize sldb-default-action.
	(sldb-var-number-at-point, sldb-inspect-var): New function.

	* swank.lisp (inspect-frame-var): New function.

	* swank-backend, swank-cmucl.lisp, swank-sbcl.lisp,
	swank-allegro.lisp, swank-lispworks.lisp, swank-clisp.lisp
	(frame-var-value): New backend function.

2004-06-24  Christophe Rhodes  <csr21@cam.ac.uk>

	* slime.el (sldb-format-reference-node): fix for when `what' is a
	list.
	(sldb-lookup-reference,sldb-reference-properties): support
	:ansi-cl :section reference types.

	* hyperspec.el (common-lisp-hyperspec-6.0): generalize to work
	with section numbers lower than 10.

2004-06-24  Brian Downing  <bdowning@lavos.net>

	* slime.el (slime-repl-send-input): Fixed a subtle difference in
	sending input to the Lisp introduced in 1.316.  The newline was
	not getting sent, resulting in the Lisp constantly asking for more
	read data.  I believe the code has been adjusted to behave the
	same as 1.315 with regard to sending newlines.
	Also adjusted the `slime-repl-old-input' text property to end just
	before the newline, not just after.  This causes a gap between
	inputs even if no Lisp output appeared in between, so that putting
	point on an old line and hitting RET will only call up that line,
	and hitting RET in the middle of the current line will send it and
	not bring up a confusing combination of all previous input.
	Many thanks to Loyd Fueston for pinpointing the date and exact
	patch for when this problem was introduced.

2004-06-23  Brian Downing  <bdowning@lavos.net>

	* slime.el: Re-added most of Luke's patches from yesterday.  It
	has the shortened names, uses markers instead of stored `(point)'
	values, and `slime-fuzzy-complete-symbol' is an option for
	`slime-complete-symbol-function'.
	It still string compares the target buffer instead of using
	`(buffer-modified-tick)'.
	I left the `C-c M-i' keybinding in, as it allows use of the
	regular completion as well.  If there's an objection to this it
	can be removed.
	`window-configuration-change-hook' is used if the variable is
	present, and ignored it not.  This neatly sidesteps its absence in
	XEmacs while not killing the functionality for GNU Emacs.

	* doc/slime.texi: Added a command entry and short description for
	`C-c M-I, slime-fuzzy-complete-symbol', and added its existence to
	the `slime-complete-symbol-function' documentation.
	
2004-06-22  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* doc/slime.texi: Noted ABCL support.

	* slime.el: Backed out all of my changes to fuzzy completion. I
	was too hasty and didn't do good things. Now it's back in pristine
	state from Brian's patch -- use `C-c M-i' to fuzzy-complete.

	* doc/Makefile (contributors.texi): The contributors list in the
	manual is now sorted by most number of ChangeLog entries. Patch
	from Michael Weber.

	* slime.el: Some minor hacking to fuzzy completion:
	Use the shorter `slime-fuzzy-' symbol prefix.
	Use markers instead of numbers to remember where the completion is
	being done. This way they are self-updating.
	Use `buffer-modified-tick' to detect modifications instead of text
	comparison.
	Always restore window configuration when a completion is
	chosen. For this completion style I think this will work okay
	[famous last words], and the existing code wasn't
	XEmacs-compatible for want of window-configuration-change-hook.
	Now there is no separate keybinding for fuzzy completion, but it's
	included as a customize option for `slime-complete-symbol-function'
	
2004-06-22  Brian Downing  <bdowning@lavos.net>

	* slime.el, swank.lisp: Added "fuzzy completion."

2004-06-22  Matthew Danish  <mdanish@andrew.cmu.edu>

	* swank-backend.lisp (unbound-slot-filler): New structure for
	representing an unbound slot in the inspector functions.

	* swank.lisp, swank-allegro.lisp: Use it.

2004-06-22  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el (slime-output-filter): Choose connection based on
	process-buffer, not current buffer. This fixes a bug where output
	from multiple Lisp sessions could get mixed up.
	(slime-kill-all-buffers): Include all *inferior-lisp*[<n>] buffers.
	Split the customize settings into more subgroups.

	* swank.lisp (prefixed-var): Intern *REAL-STANDARD-INPUT* etc in
	the SWANK package instead of the COMMON-LISP package.

2004-06-21  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* swank-loader.lisp (*lisp-name*): Add version number to
	Lispwork's fasl directory. We should do this for ACL and OpenMCL
	too, but for some reason my ACL 5.0 gets an error when trying to
	create a directory with a version number in its name, and I don't
	have OpenMCL to test with.

	* swank-backend.lisp, swank.lisp (add-hook, run-hook): Moved the
	hook mechanism and all hooks to swank.lisp (from
	swank-backend.lisp). There is no compelling use for the hooks in
	backends yet and I want to pass swank.lisp-internal data
	structures in the existing hooks.
	(notify-backend-of-connection): Call `emacs-connected' with the
	user-io stream for its argument. Should fix previous breakage
	where the connection structure was passed instead.
	(*globally-redirect-io*): New configurable: when true the standard
	streams are globally redirected to Emacs. That way even
	e.g. SERVE-EVENT handlers will print to Emacs. Currently does not
	handle standard input -- that is trickier since the Lisp's native
	REPL can be trying to read from that.

	* slime.el (slime-complete-maybe-restore-window-configuration):
	Only restore the window configuration if the completions buffer is
	currently visible in the window that we popped it up in.
	(slime-complete-maybe-save-window-configuration): Don't save the
	window configuration if the completions buffer is already visible.
	(slime-repl-return): Make sure the newline goes at the end of the
	input, not at point.
	(slime-complete-restore-window-configuration): Wrap the
	`set-window-configuration' call in (run-at-time 0 ..). XEmacs does
	not allow us to set the window configuration from inside
	pre-command-hook.

2004-06-20  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* swank-sbcl.lisp (emacs-connected): Set *invoke-debugger-hook* to
	our debugger hook.  Not optimal, but at least BREAK will then
	invoke our debugger.
	(*trap-load-time-warnings*): New variable.  If it is true,
	conditions, most notably redefinition warnings, signalled at load
	time are not trapped.
	(swank-compile-file, swank-compile-string): Use it.
	
	* swank.lisp (guess-buffer-package): Don't signal a continuable
	error if the package doesn't exists; that's too annoying.

	* slime.el: Fix outline structure.
        (slime-maybe-list-compiler-notes): Fix thinko.
	(break): New test.  Reorganize the test-suite a bit to support
	"expected failures".
	(slime-eval-feature-conditional, slime-to-feature-keyword): Add a
	?: to the symbol-name if needed.
	
2004-06-20  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* swank.lisp (changelog-date): Removed unneeded function.
	(connection-info): No more version field in result.

	* slime.el: Audited to remove namespace slipups. Tracking a really
	horrible clashing-with-some-user-configuration bug and want to
	eliminate potential symbol conflicts.
	(sldb-get-buffer): Renamed from `get-sldb-buffer'.
	(slime-emacs-20-p): Renamed from `emacs-20-p'.
	(slime-defun-if-undefined): Renamed from `defun-if-undefined'.
	(slime-isearch): Small bugfix that could cause M-. to go to the
	wrong place in CMUCL.
	(slime-changelog-date, slime-check-protocol-version): Removed
	unneeded functions.

	* swank-backend.lisp (add-hook, run-hook): Added an Emacs-like
	hook mechanism.  The hope is that this will make some sections of
	the code more self-describing by showing where they hook in.
	(*new-connection-hook*): Hook run when a new connection is
	established. Initialized to '(swank-backend:emacs-connected).
	(*pre-reply-hook*): Hook run before sending a reply to Emacs.

	* swank.lisp: Added some comments and docstrings.
	(package-external-symbols): Removed unused function.
	(serve-connection): Call *new-connection-hook*.
	(eval-for-emacs): Call *pre-reply-hook*.
	(sync-features-to-emacs, sync-indentation-to-emacs): Added to
	*pre-reply-hook*.
	(cl-package, keyword-package): Now defconstant instead of
	defvar. Removed the *'s accordingly.

	* slime.el (slime-abort-connection): Renamed from
	`slime-connection-abort'. The new name is easier to find with
	completion.

	* swank-sbcl.lisp: Change sb-posix:: to sb-posix:

2004-06-19  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* swank.lisp (known-to-emacs-p): Bugfix. Indentation-updates was
	broken.

2004-06-18  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el (slime-buffer-package): If DONT-CACHE is true and no
	package name can be found, then default to "COMMON-LISP-USER."
	Previously we just kept using the cached version, but that could
	lead to error-after-error if it was incorrect.

	* swank.lisp (throw-to-toplevel): If our top-level catcher isn't
	on the stack (i.e. we're using the debugger from outside an RPC)
	then ABORT instead. That makes 'q' DWIM in SLDB.

2004-06-18  Matthew Danish  <mdanish@andrew.cmu.edu>

	* swank-allegro.lisp (frame-source-location-for-emacs):
	Implemented.

2004-06-18  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el (slime-repl-return): If the user presses return on old
	REPL input then take it and insert it as the current input.
	Signal an error if the point is not on any input.
	(slime-preserve-zmacs-region): Function to ensure that the current
	command doesn't deactivate zmacs-region (XEmacs only).
	(slime-repl-bol, slime-repl-eol): Use it.
	(slime-kill-all-buffers): Changed buffer-name regexps for XEmacs
	compatibility. The ",quit" shortcut now works in XEmacs.
	(slime-display-message): Fixed call to `slime-typeout-message'
	to handle formatting characters. Avoids errors on certain messages.
	(slime-list-compiler-notes): Save the window configuration
	earlier. This fixes an error under XEmacs when dismissing the
	notes buffer.
	(slime-recenter-window): Avoid moving the point. This keeps the
	point in the right place when showing debugger-frame locations in
	Emacs 21.

2004-06-17  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* swank-loader.lisp (binary-pathname): Place fasl files under
	~/.slime/fasl/ instead of the SLIME installation directory. The
	installation directory can now be read-only.
	(binary-pathname, user-init-file): Removed Win32
	conditionalization. The init file is now called ~/.swank.lisp
	instead of ~/_swank.lsp.

	* swank-lispworks.lisp (with-fairly-standard-io-syntax): New
	macro. Like with-standard-io-syntax, but keeps the existing values
	of *package* and *readtable*.
	(dspec-stream-position): Use it.
	(quit-lisp): Implemented.

2004-06-16  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* slime.el (slime-set-default-directory): Don't call
	slime-repl-update-banner in Emacs 20.
	(slime-show-source-location, slime-recenter-window): Use
	set-window-start instead of recenter; this avoids flickering.
	(sldb-list-locals): Don't forget about slime-current-thread in the
	temporary buffer.  (Fixes bug reported by Mike Beedle.)
	(sldb-step): Re-enabled.  The CMUCL backend has rudimentary support
	for stepping.

	* swank.lisp (*readtable-alist*): Call backend function for
	initialization.
	(eval-for-emacs, guess-buffer-package): Signal a continuable error
	if a package name was supplied but no such package exists.  Not
	sure if this is better than what we did before (i.e. silently use
	the current package).

	* swank-cmucl.lisp (default-directory): Add implementation.
	(sldb-step): Uncomment it and remove references to
	*swank-debugger-condition*.

	* swank-backend.lisp (sldb-step, default-readtable-alist): New
	backend functions.
	(emacs-connected): Pass the redirected stream as argument, so that
	the OpenMCL backend can add it to CCL::*AUTO-FLUSH-STREAMS*.

	* swank-sbcl.lisp (default-readtable-alist): Implement it.

	* swank-loader.lisp: Move readtable-alist initialization to
	swank-sbcl.lisp.

	* swank-allegro.lisp (default-directory, call-with-syntax-hooks):
	Add implementations as workarounds for ACL5 bugs.

2004-06-16  Lawrence Mitchell <wence@gmx.li>

	* slime.el (slime-maybe-rearrange-inferior-lisp): Call
	`generate-new-buffer-name' manually, rather than relying on the
	UNIQUE argument to `rename-buffer' to do so.

2004-06-16  Frederic Brunel <frederic.brunel@in-fusio.com>

	* slime.el (slime-startup-animation): Use defcustom to declare the
	variable.
	(slime-enable-startup-animation-p): Deleted.

2004-06-16  Robert Lehr  <bozzio@the-lehrs.com>

	* slime.el (slime-backend): This variable can now be set to an
	absolute filename.

2004-06-15  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el (slime-compile-file): Just prompt for saving the
	current file instead of calling `save-some-buffers'. Based on a
	patch from Brian Downing.

2004-06-12  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* wank-allegro.lisp (format-sldb-condition, condition-references):
	Add workarounds for buggy no-applicable-method.

	* swank.lisp (parse-symbol, parse-package): Handle reader errors.

	* swank-openmcl.lisp (send, receive): Ensure that messages are
	never nil.

2004-06-10  Christophe Rhodes <csr21@cam.ac.uk>

	* swank-sbcl.lisp (call-with-syntax-hooks): Add hooks to fix
	"SB!"-style package names.
	(shebang-readtable): Return a readtable with readermacros needed
	to parse SBCL sources.

	* swank.lisp (with-buffer-syntax): New macro.  This should be used
	for code which needs to READ code from Emacs buffers.  *package*
	and *readtable* are bound suitable values.
	(to-string, format-values-for-echo-area, interactive-eval)
	(eval-region, interactive-eval-region, re-evaluate-defvar)
	(swank-pprint, pprint-eval, listener-eval)
	(compile-string-for-emacs, disassemble-symbol, describe-to-string)
	(describe-symbol, describe-function)
	(describe-definition-for-emacs)
	(documentation-symbol, init-inspector, inspect-nth-part)
	(inspector-pop, inspector-next, describe-inspectee)
	(inspect-current-condition): Use it.

2004-06-10  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* swank-loader.lisp: Initialize swank::*readtable-alist* for SBCL.

	* swank-backend.lisp (default-directory, call-with-syntax-hooks):
	New functions.

	* swank.lisp (*readtable-alist*): New configurable.  The keys are
	package name and the values readtables.  The readtable will be
	used to READ code originating from Emacs buffers in the associated
	slime-buffer-package.
	(drop-thread): Simplified.
	(*buffer-readtable*): New variable.
	(parse-package): New function.
	(parse-string): Renamed from symbol-from-string.  Make it case
	insensitive.
	(eval-for-emacs): Initialize the *buffer-readtable*.
	(symbol-indentation): Don't consider symbols in the CL package.
	Emacs already knows how to indent them.
	(compile-file-if-needed): Used for REPL shortcut
	'compile-and-load'.

	* slime.el (pwd): Re-add REPL shortcut.
	(slime-repl-push-directory, slime-repl-compile-and-load): Simplified.

2004-06-10  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el (sldb-step): Command is disabled because the function
	`swank:sldb-step' that it calls doesn't exist. I don't see any
	stepping code in our backends.

2004-06-09  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* slime.el (slime-goto-location-position) [:function-name]: The
	function name can also occur after a ?(, not only after
	whitespace.

	* (slime-init-output-buffer): Initialize the package stack.
	Reported by Rui Patrocínio.

	* (slime-completions): Make it consistent with
	slime-simple-completions. The second argument was never supplied.
	Reported by Rui Patrocínio.
	
2004-06-09  Eric Blood <eblood@winkywooster.org>

	* slime.el (slime-indent-and-complete-symbol): Renamed from
	slime-repl-indent-and-complete-symbol.

	(slime-typeout-frame-properties): Add more default options for the
	typeout frame--specifically it now has a default width, and moves
	the typeout frame to the upper right.

2004-06-09  Andras Simon <andras@renyi.hu>

	* swank-abcl.lisp: New backend for Armed Bear Common Lisp.
	
	* swank-loader.lisp: Add ABCL support.

2004-06-09  Martin Simmons <martin@xanalys.com>

	* swank-lispworks.lisp (dspec-stream-position): New function to
	make source location work for anything complicated e.g. methods.
	(with-swank-compilation-unit): Refactoring.
	(who-macroexpands): Implemented.
	(list-callers): Implemented.

	* swank-backend.lisp (network-error): Inherit from simple-error to
	get correct initargs.

2004-06-09  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el (sldb-insert-references): Added support for hyperlinked
	references as part of conditions being debugged. This is a new
	feature in SBCL to reference appropriate sections of their manual
	or CLHS from condition objects. The references are clickable.

	* swank-backend.lisp (format-sldb-condition): New backend function
	to format conditions for SLDB.
	(condition-references): New function to return a list of
	documentation references associated with a condition.

	* swank.lisp (debugger-condition-for-emacs): Call the above
	backend functions to add a `references' list for Emacs.

	* swank-sbcl.lisp (format-sldb-condition, condition-references):
	Implemented. Requires a recent (latest?) SBCL release.

2004-06-08  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* swank-cmucl.lisp (close-socket): Remove any SERVE-EVENT handlers
	for the socket's file descriptor.

	* swank-sbcl.lisp (close-socket): Same fix.

2004-06-07  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* swank-cmucl.lisp: Minor refactorings.

2004-06-07  Edi Weitz  <edi@agharta.de>

	* swank-allegro.lisp (call-with-compilation-hooks): Implemented.
	Wrap IMPORT call in EVAL-WHEN.

	* swank.lisp, swank-backend.lisp: Wrap EXPORT calls in
	EVAL-WHEN. Fixes many warnings in ACL.

2004-05-25  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el (slime-kill-without-query-p): Default to T.
	(sldb-highlight): Variable to control face-based highlighting of
	SLDB locations. (In Emacs21 the point is visible even in unselected
	windows, which is sufficient for me.)
	(sldb-show-location-recenter-arg): Argument to `recenter' when
	showing SLDB locations. Default to nil, i.e. location appears in
	the middle of the window.

2004-05-24  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* slime.el (slime-input-complete-p): Return nil for unbalanced
	sexps starting with quote ?', backquote ?`, or hash ?#.  C-j can
	be used for more complicated cases.

2004-05-22  Marco Baringer  <mb@bese.it>

	* slime.el (slime-repl-sayoonara): Added "quit" as an alias for
	sayoonara.

2004-05-22  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* swank-cmucl.lisp (arglist): Catch (reader) errors in
	READ-ARGLIST.

	* swank-allegro.lisp (fspec-primary-name): New function.
	(find-fspec-location): Use it, if the start position cannot be
	found.

	* slime.el (slime-pprint-event): New function.
	(slime-log-event): Use it.
	(slime-reindent-defun): Indent the form after point, if point is
	in the first column an immediately before a #\(.

2004-05-21 Bill Clementson <Bill_Clementson@peoplesoft.com>

	* slime.el (slime-switch-to-output-buffer): Use "P" as interactive
	spec.
	
2004-05-21  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* slime.el (slime-switch-to-output-buffer): Override the
	prefix-arg if we are called non-interactively.
	(slime-repl-current-input): Don't add newlines.
	(slime-repl-return): Send input if we are in read-mode also if it
	isn't a complete expression.
	(repl-read-lines): New test case.
	(slime-enable-startup-animation-p): New configurable.
	(slime-repl-update-banner): Use it.
	(slime-hide-inferior-lisp-buffer): New function. Reuse the
	*inferior-lisp* buffer window for the SLIME REPL.

	* swank-allegro.lisp (find-fspec-location): Better handling of
	methods.  From Bill Clementson.

2004-05-17  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* xref.lisp, swank-clisp.lisp: Renamed XREF package to PXREF (P
	for portable). This makes it possible to load the package in
	e.g. CMUCL, which is nice because it's a good package.

	* swank-cmucl.lisp: Some refactoring and high-level
	commenting. Mostly just trying to organise things into fairly
	self-contained sections (my new hobby, sad I know!)

	* slime.el: Added `C-c C-e' as an alternative binding for
	`slime-interactive-eval' (usually `C-c :'). This seems slightly
	more convenient, and has the added bonus of clobbering an unwanted
	`inf-lisp' binding.

2004-05-14  Marco Baringer <mb@bese.it>

	* slime.el (slime-with-output-to-temp-buffer): Now takes a
	package arg specifying what slime-buffer-package should be in the
	generated buffer. 
	(slime-show-description): actually pass the package arg.
	(slime-show-apropos): pass the package arg to
	slime-with-output-to-temp-buffer.
	(slime-list-repl-shortcuts): pass a package arg.
	
2004-05-12  Alan Ruttenberg  <alanr-l@mumble.net>
	* swank-openmcl.lisp: Fixes to support openmcl 0.14.2 changes in
	backtrace protocol, from Gary Byers.
	- Replace string "tcr" to "context".
	- Change the call to %current-tcr in map-backtrace to get-backtrace-context, 
	defined so as to be back compatible with 0.14.1.
	- Change the call to %catch-top to explicitly use %current-tcr
	instead of the passed in tcr-which-is-now-called-context.

	Users of map-backtrace (outside of slime code) note: The tcr position in the
	function call is now occupied by the backtrace "context" which is always nil.
	If you really need the tcr then you need to call %current-tcr yourself now.
	
	Gary comments: The part that's a little hard to document about
	the new "context" stuff - used to walk the stacks of thread A from
	thread B - is that thread B has to be aware of when a context
	becomes invalid (a context describing part of thread A's stack is
	valid while thread A's sitting in a break loop and becomes invalid
	as soon as it exits that break loop.)  A thread sort of announces
	when a context becomes valid and when it becomes invalid; whether
	and how SWANK could hook into that isn't yet clear.

	* swank-openmcl.lisp: Minor changes to backtrace display: Anonymous 
	functions names in function position surrounded by #<>. Use prin1 instead of 
	princ to print function arguments (so strings have "s around them). 
	prefix symbol and list arguments by "'" to make them more look like a 
	valid function call. Let me know if you don't like this...

2004-05-12  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el: Fixes for outline-mode in *slime-events* from Edi
	Weitz.

2004-05-11  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* slime.el (slime-events-buffer): Disable outline-mode by default.
	(slime-inhibit-ouline-mode-in-events-buffer): New variable.
	(slime-expected-failures): Reduce the number for SBCL.
	
	* swank-sbcl.lisp (resolve-note-location): Resolve the location if
	we are called by swank-compile-string.  The pathname argument is
	never :stream in SBCL, so the method written for CMUCL was never
	called.

2004-05-10  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* swank.lisp (from-string): Bind *READ-SUPPRESS* to NIL.
	(swank-compiler): Bind a restart to abort compilation but still
	report the compiler messages already trapped.
	(string-to-package-designator): Function that uses READ to
	case-convert package names.
	(apropos-list-for-emacs): Use it.

	* slime.el (slime-eval-with-transcript): Don't print the "=>"
	prefix in messages showing evaluation results. It mucks up
	alignment in multi-line messages.
	(sldb-eval-in-frame): Don't print "==>" prefix on evaluation
	results, for the same reason.
	(slime-show-source-location): Move the point to the source
	location in addition to highlighting the matching parens.

2004-05-08  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* swank-cmucl.lisp (find-definitions): Add support for variables
	and constants.

2004-05-07  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* swank-clisp.lisp (compiler-note-location): Use make-location to
	instead of `(:location ...). This initializes the new hint slot
	automatically.

2004-05-07  Barry Fishman <barry_fishman@att.net>

	* swank.lisp (prin1-to-string-for-emacs, arglist-to-string): CVS
	CLISP prints NIL as |COMMON-LISP|::|NIL| if *print-readably* is
	true.  Set *print-readably* to nil for a more Emacs friendly
	printer syntax.

2004-05-06   Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* slime.el (slime-maybe-list-compiler-notes): Display the notes
	listing after C-c C-c only if there are no annotations in the
	buffer.  CMUCL creates usually one warning with an error location
	and an almost redundant warning without at the end of the
	compilation unit.  Don't display the listing in this common case.

	(slime-reindent-defun): Pass nil as the third arument to
	indent-region.

2004-05-06  Marco Baringer <mb@bese.it>

	* slime.el (slime-repl-sayoonara): Don't attempt to quit the lisp
	if we're not connected.

	* swank-openmcl.lisp (*buffer-offset*, *buffer-name*): Supply
	default values. This avoids unbound value errors when compiling an
	asdf system signals errors.
	
2004-05-04  Alan Shutko  <ats@acm.org>

	* slime.el (slime-compiler-notes-show-details/mouse): New command.
	(slime-compiler-notes-mode-map): Use it.

2004-05-04   Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* swank-cmucl.lisp (arglist): Handle byte-code functions better.
	We don't know much about the actual argument list, only the number
	of arguments.  Return at least something mildly interesting like
	 (arg0 arg1 &optional arg2 ...)
	(function-location): Special-case byte-code functions.

	* swank-backend.lisp (with-struct): New macro.

2004-05-04 Thomas F. Burdick  <tfb@OCF.Berkeley.EDU>

	* slime.el (slime-reindent-defun): New command on C-M-q. Reindent
	the current Lisp defun after trying to close any unmatched
	parenthesis. If used within a comment it just calls fill-paragraph.

2004-05-04  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el (slime-goto-location-position): Regexp fix.
	(slime-reindent-defun): New command on M-q. Reindent the current
	Lisp defun after trying to close any unmatched parenthesis.

	* swank.lisp: Remove (declaim (optimize ...)). The side-effect
	this has on people's environment seems harmful (I saw someone
	having trouble on the OpenMCL list).

	* swank-cmucl.lisp (source-location-from-code-location): Fixed a
	bug where the source-file-cache was not really used.
	Now always report the location based on source file (cached or
	not) even if modified -- not falling back on regexps, which was
	probably a misfeature.

	* slime.el: Remove `slime-cleanup-definition-refs'.

2004-05-02   Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* slime.el (slime-start-and-load): New command.  Suggested by
	Lars Magne Ingebrigtsen.

2004-05-02  Lars Magne Ingebrigtsen  <larsi@netfonds.no>

	* slime.el (slime-kill-without-query-p): New variable.
	(slime-net-connect): Use it.
	(slime-open-stream-to-lisp): Ditto.
	(slime-maybe-start-lisp): Ditto.

2004-05-02  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el (slime-goto-source-location): Added support for the
	:snippet "hint" in a location specifier. If Lisp sends the
	(initial) source text for the definition then Emacs isearches for
	it in both directions from the given character position. This
	makes M-. robust when the Emacs buffer has been edited. Requires
	backends to provide this snippet information.
	(slime-goto-location-position): Tightened up the regular
	expressions for :function-name style location search.
	(slime-cleanup-definition-refs): New function to do a little
	post-processing on definition references from Lisp. Mostly this is
	a hack: if POSITION is NIL then we fill it in with the function
	name, ready for regexp search. I was in a hurry and it was easier
	to do here, and it doesn't seem entirely unreasonable.

	* swank-backend.lisp (:location): Added a 'hints' property list
	to the location structure. This is for extra information that
	compliments the buffer/position.

	* swank-cmucl.lisp (code-location-stream-position): Position the
	argument stream at the definition before returning.
	(source-location-from-code-location): Include the :snippet hint
	for Emacs (see above). The snippet will only be accurate provided
	that the source file on disk has not been modified.
	(*source-file-cache*) The contents of all source files consulted
	for M-. are now cached if they match the version of the running
	code. This is so that we can accurately lookup source locations
	even when the file is modified, provided we manage to get the
	right version (by file timestamp) at least once.
	(source-location-from-code-location): If the right source version
	is not available on disk or in our cache then let Emacs fall back
	on a regular expression search.

2004-05-01   Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* swank-lispworks.lisp (find-top-frame): New function used to hide
	debugger-internal frames.
	(call-with-debugging-environment): Use it.

2004-05-01  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el (sldb-abort): Print a message if the Emacs RPC
	returns. It shouldn't, if ABORT manages to unwind the stack, but
	it currently does in OpenMCL due to some bug.
	(slime-edit-definition-fallback-function): Name of a function to
	try if the builtin edit-definition finding fails. You can set
	this to `find-tag' to fall back on TAGS.

	* swank.lisp (list-all-systems-in-central-registry): Use explicit
	:wild in pathname for matching (needed in at least SBCL).

	* swank-openmcl.lisp: Removed obsolete `swank-compile-system'.

	* swank-sbcl.lisp: Removed obsolete `swank-compile-system'.
	Removed some stale comments about supported features.

2004-04-30   Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* slime.el (slime-repl-update-banner): Don't print the working
	directory.  It rarely fits in a line and was only Emacs'
	default-directory.  M-x pwd is convenient enough.

	* swank.lisp (symbol-indentation): Don't infer indentation for
	symbols starting with 'def' or 'with-'.  It was wrong most of the
	time and Emacs' defaults are better.

	* swank-lispworks.lisp (emacs-connected): Add methods to
	stream-soft-force-output for socket-streams and
	slime-output-streams.  This flushes those streams automatically
	(i assume it gets called when Lisp is idle).

2004-04-29   Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* slime.el (slime-repl-mode): Set slime-current-thread to
	:repl-thread.

	* swank.lisp (thread-for-evaluation, dispatch-event): Accept
	:repl-thread as thread specifier and dispatch evaluation and
	interrupt request properly.
	(repl-thread-eval, repl-eval): Deleted. We do the special casing in
	thread-for-evaluation.

2004-04-29  Lars Magne Ingebrigtsen  <larsi@netfonds.no>

	* slime.el (slime-event-buffer-name): New variable.
	(slime-events-buffer): Use it.
	(slime-space-information-p): Ditto.
	(slime-space): Use it.
	(slime-reply-update-banner-p): Ditto.
	(slime-repl-update-banner): Use it.

2004-04-28   Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* swank-loader.lisp (*lisp-name*): Add versioning support for
	CLISP.

	* swank-clisp.lisp (arglist): Trap exceptions and return
	:not-available in that case.

	* swank.lisp (arglist-for-insertion): Don't use ~< ..~:@>.
	CLISP's pretty printer can't handle it.

2004-04-28  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* NEWS: Created a NEWS file for recording changes that we want
	users to read about.

	* slime.el (slime-log-event): Use outline-minor-mode in
	*slime-events* instead of hideshow-mode. It's more
	reliable. (Patch from Lawrence Mitchell.)

2004-04-28  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* slime.el (slime-net-connect): Bind inhibit-quit to nil, so that
	we have a chance to interrupt Emacs if open-network-stream blocks.
	(slime-complete-maybe-restore-window-configuration): Keep trying
	after slime-repl-indent-and-complete-symbol.
	(slime-space): Don't close the completion buffer.  We don't know
	the window-config before the completion, so leave the buffer open.

	* swank.lisp (create-server): New keyword based variant to start
	the server in background.
	(setup-server): Add support to keep the socket open for
	single-threaded Lisps.
	
2004-04-27  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* doc/slime.texi (Other configurables): Updated instructions on
	globally installing SLDB on *debugger-hook*.

	* slime.el (slime-log-event): Better bug-avoidance with
	hs-minor-mode. Hopefully XEmacs users can rest safely now.
	(slime-prin1-to-string): Bind `print-escape-newlines' to nil.
	(slime-set-connection-info): Commented out call to
	`slime-check-protocol-version'. Let's see how we do without it.
	(slime-oneway-eval): Removed unused function.

	* swank.lisp (oneway-eval-string): Removed unused function.

2004-04-26  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* swank.lisp: Move definition of `with-io-redirection' above
	`with-connection' to avoid a CLISP error. This is really weird.
	(interactive-eval): Bind *package* to *buffer-package*, so that
	`C-x C-e' and related commands evaluate in the expected package.

	* slime.el (sldb-insert-frames): Handle empty backtrace (I got one
	in CLISP).

	* swank-allegro.lisp (arglist): Return :not-available if arglist
	lookup fails with an error.

	* slime.el: Moved snippets of Common Lisp code into swank.lisp
	from the thread control panel. (Remember, no CL code in slime.el!)

	* swank-loader.lisp (*lisp-name*): Include a short version number
	in the Lisp name to separate FASL files for different
	versions. Only implemented for CMUCL and SBCL sofar.

	* swank.lisp (ed-in-emacs): Avoid mutating the argument.
	(spawn-repl-thread): Add a new thread for evaluating REPL
	expressions. This same thread is used for all REPL
	evaluation. This fixes some issues with variables like * and **
	in at least SBCL.

	* nregex.lisp: Typo fix (thanks Barry Fishman).

	* slime.el (slime-events-buffer): Don't use hideshow-mode in
	XEmacs for the *slime-events* buffer. It causes obscure problems
	for some users. Still used in GNU Emacs.

2004-04-25  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* swank-backend.lisp (arglist): Return a list or :not-available.
	Don't return strings or raise exceptions.

	* swank.lisp (arglist-for-echo-area): Simplified and adapted for
	the new semantic of ARGLIST.
	(arglist-for-insertion): Now a separate function.
	(read-arglist): Deleted. No longer needed.

	* swank-cmucl.lisp, swank-lispworks.lisp (arglist): Return
	:not-available if the arglist cannot be determined.

	* slime.el (slime-set-connection-info): Hide the *inferior-lisp*
	buffer here, so that we have all the buffer rearrangement in one
	place.
	(slime-insert-arglist): Use swank:arglist-for-insertion.

2004-04-24  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* slime.el (slime-init-connection-state): Use an asynchronous RPC
	instead of slime-eval to reduce the amount of work we do in the
	timer function.  We can remove the workaround for the timer
	problem.

2004-04-23  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el: Updated top comments.
	Make SLIME faces inherit from their font-lock cousins properly.
	(slime-connect): Bind `slime-dispatching-connection' to avoid
	being confused by old buffer-local variables when initializing
	the connection. This fixes a bug where doing `M-x slime' from the
	REPL could give a "Not connected" error.

2004-04-22  Edi Weitz <edi@agharta.de>

	* slime.el (slime-read-system-name): Perform completion on all
	systems in the central registry.

	* swank.lisp (list-all-systems-in-central-registry): New function.
	
2004-04-22  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* slime.el (slime-repl-update-banner): Add workaround to force the
	proper behavior of the the first command in the REPL buffer.
	(slime-repl-shortcut-history): Define the variable to make XEmacs
	happy.

2004-04-22  Tiago Maduro-Dias <tcmd@rnl.ist.utl.pt>

	* slime.el (slime-space): Cleanup.
	(slime-complete-restore-window-configuration): Use
	slime-close-buffer instead of bury-buffer.

2004-04-21  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* slime.el: Suppress byte-compiler warnings by binding
	byte-compiler-warnings to nil.
	(slime-repl-shortcut): Use a structure instead of a list for the
	short cut info.  Update the users accordingly.

	* swank-cmucl.lisp (arglist): Return a list instead of the string.

2004-04-21  Edi Weitz <edi@agharta.de>

	* slime.el (slime-apropos): Add support for regexp-based apropos.
	We use nregex, so the regexp syntax is different from Emacs'
	regexps and bit restricted (alternation '|' and optional groups
	'(xy)?' are not implemented).
 	(slime-insert-arglist): New command - stolen from ILISP. I always
	thought this was quite useful. 
	(slime-oos): Fix typo.

	* swank.lisp (apropos-symbols): Use regexp and support
	case-sensitive matching.
	(arglist-for-echo-area): New argument to control if the operator
	name should be included.

	* nregex.lisp: New file.

	* swank-loader.lisp (*sysdep-pathnames*): Load it.

2004-04-21  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* doc/slime.texi (Compilation): slime-remove-notes is bound to C-c
	M-c not M-c.  Noted by Edi Weitz.
	
2004-04-21  Edi Weitz <edi@agharta.de>

	* swank.lisp (list-all-package-names): Optionally include
	nicknames in the result.

	* slime.el (slime-read-package-name): Include nicknames in the
	completions set.
	(slime-repl-mode-map): Bind C-c : to slime-interactive-eval just
	like in most other SLIME buffers.
	(read-directory-name): Compatibilty defun.
	
2004-04-20  Tiago Maduro-Dias <tcmd@rnl.ist.utl.pt>

	* slime.el (slime-close-buffer): New utility function.
	(slime-space): Use it to kill superfluous *Completions* buffers.

2004-04-17  Raymond Toy <rtoy@earthlink.net>

	* swank-cmucl.lisp (source-location-tlf-number)
	(source-location-form-number): New functions to extract the
	encoded form-numbers from source locations.
	(resolve-stream-source-location, resolve-file-source-location):
	Use them.

2004-04-17  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* slime.el (slime-merge-notes): Use mapconcat instead of
	(concat (slime-intersperse (mapcar ....)))
	(slime-intersperse): Handle empty lists.

2004-04-16  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* doc/Makefile: Added 'install' and 'uninstall' targets for the
	Info manual. It may be necessary to tweak `infodir' in the
	Makefile to suit the local system before installing. (Patch from
	from Richard M Kreuter.)

	* doc/slime.texi (Top): The Top node is now smaller, with details
	moved into Introduction. This makes the Info front page easier to
	navigate. (Patch from Richard M Kreuter.)

2004-04-15  Ivan Boldyrev  <email@secret-by-request>

	* slime.el (slime-handle-repl-shortcut): Call `completing-read'
	with an alist as expected, using `slime-bogus-completion-alist'.

2004-04-14  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* doc/slime.texi (Shortcuts): Described REPL shortcuts.

	* slime.el (slime-oos): Generic ASDF interface.
	(force-compile-system, compile-system, load-system,
	force-load-system): New REPL commands.

	* swank-backend.lisp (operate-on-system): More generic interface
	to ASDF.

	* swank.lisp (operate-on-system-for-emacs): More generic
	interface to ASDF.

	* slime.el (slime-repl-mode-map): Portability fix for definition
	of the REPL command character.
	(slime-maybe-rearrange-inferior-lisp): Bugfix for running
	multiple inferior lisps.

2004-04-13  Marco Baringer  <mb@bese.it>

	* slime.el (slime-handle-repl-shortcut,
	slime-list-all-repl-shortcuts, slime-lookup-shortcut,
	defslime-repl-shortcut): Refactor repl shortcut code to provide a
	more leggible help.

2004-04-09  Lawrence Mitchell  <wence@gmx.li>

	* slime.el (slime-same-line-p): Use `line-end-position', rather
	than searching for a newline manually.
	(slime-repl-defparameter): Use VALUE, not VALUE-FORM.

2004-04-08  Marco Baringer  <mb@bese.it>

	* slime.el (slime-repl-package-stack): New buffer local variable.
	(slime-repl-directory-stack): New buffer local variable.
	(slime-repl-command-input-complete-p): Remove.
	(slime-repl-update-banner): New function.
	(slime-init-output-buffer): Use slime-repl-update-banner.
	(slime-repl-shortcut-dispatch-char): New variable.
	(slime-repl-return): Don't check for repl commands anymore.
	(slime-repl-send-repl-command): Remove.
	(slime-repl-mode-map): Bind slime-repl-shortcut-dispatch-char to
	slime-handle-repl-shortcut.
	(slime-set-default-directory): Use read-directory-name, call
	slime-repl-update-banner.
	(slime-repl-shortcut-table): New global variable.
	(slime-handle-repl-shortcut): New function.
	(defslime-repl-shortcut): New macro for defining repl shortcuts.
	(slime-repl-shortcut-help, "change-directory",
	slime-repl-push-directory, slime-repl-pop-directory,
	"change-package", slime-repl-push-package, slime-repl-pop-package,
	slime-repl-resend, slime-repl-sayoonara, slime-repl-defparameter,
	slime-repl-compile-and-load): New repl shortcuts.
	(slime-kill-all-buffers): Kill sldb buffers as well.

	* swank.lisp: Remove the repl related functions.
	(requires-compile-p): New function.
	
2004-04-07  Lawrence Mitchell  <wence@gmx.li>

	* slime.el (slime-repl-prompt-face): New face.
	(slime-repl-insert-prompt): Use it.
	(slime-with-chosen-connection, with-struct): Docstring
	fix for function's arglist display.
	(when-let, slime-with-chosen-connection, with-struct): Docstring
	fix for function's arglist display.
	(slime-read-package-name): Use `slime-bogus-completion-alist' to
	construct completion table.
	(slime-maybe-rearrange-inferior-lisp): Use `rename-buffer's
	optional argument to rename uniquely.
	(slime-check-connected): Display keybinding for `slime' via
	`substitute-command-keys'.
	(slime-repl-send-repl-command): Use whitespace character class in
	regexp.
	(slime-autodoc-stop-timer): New function.
	(slime-autodoc-mode): Add `interactive' spec to specify optional
	arg.  This allows prefix toggling of mode (behaves more like
	most Emacs modes now).  Stop timer if switching mode off with
	`slime-autodoc-stop-timer'.
	(slime-autodoc-start-timer, slime-complete-symbol)
	(slime-complete-saved-window-configuration)
	(slime-insert-balanced-comments): Docstring fix.
	(slime-ed): Call `slime-from-lisp-filename' on filename for list
	case of argument.
	(slime-insert-transcript-delimiter, slime-thread-insert): Use
	?\040 to indicate SPC.
	(line-beginning-position): `forward-line' always puts us in
	column 0.
	(line-end-position): Define if not fboundp (for older XEmacs).

2004-04-07  Peter Seibel  <peter@javamonkey.com>

	* swank-allegro.lisp (set-default-directory): Allegro specific
	version that also uses excl:chdir.

	* swank.lisp (swank-pprint): Add swank versions of two missing
	pretty-printer control variables.

2004-04-07  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* swank.lisp (completion-set): Also complete package
	names. (Patch from Sean O'Rourke.)
	(find-matching-packages): Add a ":" to the end of package names
	in completion.

2004-04-06  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el (slime-bytecode-stale-p): Automatically check if
	slime.elc is older than slime.el and try to help the user out if
	so.

2004-04-06  Marco Baringer  <mb@bese.it>

	* slime.el (slime-repl-command-input-complete-p): New function.
	(slime-repl-send-string): New optional arg specifying what string
	to put on slime-repl-input-history, usefull when this string
	differs from what we actually want to eval.
	(slime-repl-return): Check for repl commands and pass then to
	slime-repl-send-repl-command.
	(slime-repl-send-repl-command): New function.
	(slime-kill-all-buffers): New function.
	
	* swank.lisp: Define the various repl command handlers: sayoonara,
	cd, pwd, pack and cload.
	
	* swank-backend.lisp (quit-lisp): Define as part of the backend
	interface and export.
	
	* swank-sbcl.lisp, swank-openmcl.lisp, swank-cmucl.lisp,
	swank-clisp.lisp, swank-allegro.lisp (quit-lisp): implement.

2004-04-06  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* swank.lisp (macro-indentation): Check that the arglist is
	well-formed. This works around a problem with ACL returning
	arglists that aren't real lambda-lists.

2004-04-05  Lawrence Mitchell  <wence@gmx.li>

	* swank.lisp (*swank-pprint-circle*, *swank-pprint-escape*)
	(*swank-pprint-level*, *swank-pprint-length*): Fix typo in
	docstring.

	* slime.el (slime-arglist): Don't `message' arglist directly, in
	case it contains %-signs.
	(slime-repl-output-face): Fix quoting.
	(slime-symbol-at-point): Call `slime-symbol-name-at-point',
	rather than ourselves.
	(slime-check-protocol-version): Docstring fix.

2004-04-05  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* doc/slime.texi (Semantic indentation): Documented new
	automatically-learn-how-to-indent-macros feature.
	Added auto version control header in subtitle.

	* slime.el (slime-close-parens-at-point): New command bound to
	C-a C-a. Inserts close-parenthesis characters at point until the
	top-level form becomes well formed. Could perhaps be made fancier.
	(slime-update-indentation): New command to update indentation
	information (`common-lisp-indent-function' properties) based on
	macro information extracted from Lisp. This happens
	automatically, the command is just to force a full rescan.

	* swank.lisp (connection): Added slots to track indentation caching.
	(*connections*): List of all open connections.
	(default-connection): Function to get a "default"
	connection. This is intended to support globally using the
	debugger hook outside the context of a SLIME request, which is
	broken at present.
	(with-connection): Don't setup a restart: that must be done
	separately.
	(sync-state-to-emacs): Call `update-connection-indentation'.
	(update-connection-indentation): Automatically discover how to
	indent macros and tell Emacs.

	* swank-backend.lisp (arglist): Specify that strings returned
	from ARGLIST should be READable.

2004-04-02  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* slime.el (slime-maybe-list-compiler-notes): Display the notes
	for C-c C-c, when there are notes without a good source-location.

2004-04-01  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* swank-sbcl.lisp: Remove the non-working workarounds for
	non-existent fcntl.  Reported by Brian Mastenbrook.
	(preferred-communication-style): Use multithreading if futexes are
	available, sigio if fcntl is present, and fd-handlers otherwise.
	(resolve-note-location): Don't try to construct a source-location
	if there's no context.  Notes without location will be displayed
	in the note-listing buffer.

2004-04-01  Bill Clementson <Bill_Clementson@peoplesoft.com>

	* swank-allegro.lisp (send): Fix misplaced parens.

2004-03-31  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* swank-cmucl.lisp (debug-function-arglist): Return symbols if
	possible.
	(class-location): Support for experimental source-location
	recording.

2004-03-30  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* slime.el (slime-repl-result-face): New face.
	(slime-inspector-mode-map): Add a binding for M-.
	(compile-defun): Add test case for escaped double quotes inside a
	string.

	(pprint-eval-string-in-frame): Apply arguments in proper order.

	* swank-cmucl.lisp (method-dspec): Include method-qualifiers.
	(class-definitions): Renamed from struct-definitions.  Try to
	locate condition-classes and PCL classes (in the future).
	(debug-function-arglist): Insert &optional, &key, &rest in the
	right places.
	(form-number-stream-position): Make it a separate function.

2004-03-29  Lawrence Mitchell  <wence@gmx.li>

	* swank.lisp (ed-in-emacs): New allowed form for argument.

	* slime.el (slime-ed): Deal with list form of argument.  For a
	list (FILENAME LINE [COLUMN]), visit the correct line and column
	number.

2004-03-29  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* swank-source-path-parser.lisp (cmucl-style-get-macro-character):
	New function. Workaround for bug(?) in SBCL.
	(make-source-recording-readtable): Use it.

2004-03-29  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* HACKING: Some small updates (more needed).

	* slime.el (slime-inspector-buffer): Enter `slime-inspector-mode'
	after `slime-mode'. This seems to give priority of keymap to the
	inspector, so that it can override SPC.
	(slime-easy-menu): Add slime-switch-to-output-buffer.
	Enable SLIME menu in the REPL buffer.
	(slime-symbol-name-at-point): Avoid mistaking the REPL prompt for
	a symbol.
	(slime-words-of-encouragement): A few new ones.
	(slime-insert-xrefs): Removed the final newline from XREF
	buffers. This helps to avoid unwanted scrolling.

	* doc/slime.texi: Added a section about user-interface
	conventions and our relationship with inf-lisp.

2004-03-27  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* slime.el (slime-changelog-date): Reinitialize it at load-time.
	This avoids the need to restart Emacs (horror!) after an update.

	* swank-cmucl.lisp (debug-function-arglist): Properly reconstruct
	the arglist from the debug-info. (Not complete yet.)
	(arglist): Use it.

	* swank-lispworks.lisp (spawn): Remove CL symbols from
	mp:*process-initial-bindings*, to avoid the irritating behavior
	for requests executed in different threads.  E.g., when someone
	tries to set *package*.

	* swank.lisp (*log-io*): New variable.  Bind it to *terminal-io*
	at load-time, so we can log to a non-redirected stream.
	(disassemble-symbol): Allow generalized function names.
	(apropos-symbols): Handle the PACKAGE argument properly to get
	useful output for C-c P.

	* slime.el (slime-repl-indent-and-complete-symbol): New command.
	Bound to TAB in the REPL mode.  First try to indent the current
	line then try to complete the symbol at point.
	(slime-dispatch-event): Ignore a unused thread variable to keep
	XEmacs' byte compiler quiet.

	* swank-sbcl.lisp (enable-sigio-on-fd): Use sb-posix::fcntl
	instead of sb-posix:fcntl to avoid the ugly reader hack.  SBCL
	doesn't have package locks and even if they add locks in the
	future sb-posix::fcntl will still be valid.
	(getpid): Use defimplementation instead of defmethod.
	(function-definitions): Take generalized function names ala '(setf
	car)' as argument.

2004-03-26  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el (slime-group-similar): Bugfix: return NIL if the input
	list is NIL.
	(slime-inspector-buffer): Enter `slime-inspector-mode' after
	`slime-mode'. This seems to give priority of keymap to the
	inspector, so that it can override SPC.

2004-03-26  Bjørn Nordbø <bn@telenor.net>

	* swank.lisp (print-arglist): Updated to handle arglists with
	string elements, causing arglists for macros to display properly
	in LW 4.1.

2004-03-26  Marco Baringer <mb@bese.it>

	* swank-cmucl.lisp (set-default-directory): Define only once;
	define with defimplementation, not defun.

2004-03-26  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el (slime-merge-notes-for-display): New function to merge
	together compiler notes that refer to the same location. This is
	an optimization for when there are a lot of compiler notes:
	`slime-merge-note-into-overlay' concat'd messages together one by
	one in O(n^2) time/space, and became noticeably slow in practice
	with ~100 notes or more.
	(slime-tree-insert): This function is now automatically
	byte-compiled (good speed gain).
	Wrap byte-compilation in `save-window-excursion' to avoid showing

2004-02-26  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* swank-backend.lisp (:swank): export connection-info.

	* swank-allegro.lisp (lisp-implementation-type-name): Implement
	it.

	* swank-sbcl.lisp (compile-file-for-emacs): Load the fasl file
	regardless of f-p.

	* swank.lisp (swank-pprint): Bind *package* to *buffer-package*.
	Reported by Alan Picard.

	* swank-lispworks.lisp (dspec-buffer-position): Renamed from
	dspec-buffer-buffer-position.  Handle dspecs of the form (defmacro
	foo).  Reported by Alan Picard.
	(arglist-string): Handle unknown arglists properly.

2004-02-25  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* swank-cmucl.lisp (arglist-string): Delay the call to

	(compile-file-for-emacs): Load the fasl file irrespective of
	COMILE-FILE's third return value.

	* swank.lisp (connection-info): New function.
	(open-streams): Don't send the :check-protocol-version message.  Now
	handled with CONNECTION-INFO.

	* slime.el (slime-symbol-at-point): Don't skip backwards across
	whitespace when we are at the first character of a symbol.  To
	handle this case: skip symbol constituents forward before skipping
	whitespace backwards.  Reported by Jan Richter.
	(slime-connection-close-hook, slime-next-connection)
	(slime-make-default-connection): Remove extra call to format.
	(slime-init-connection-state): Use only a single RPC instead of 4.

2004-02-25  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* slime.el (slime-with-chosen-connection): Bind
	slime-dispatching-connection and not slime-buffer-connection.
	slime-buffer-connection is a buffer local variable not a dynamic
	variable.
	(slime-find-connection-by-type-name)
	(slime-read-lisp-implementation-type-name): Were lost during the
	merge.
	(sldb-fetch-more-frames): Use (goto-char (point-max)) instead of
	end-of-buffer. 

2004-02-25  Peter Seibel  <peter@javamonkey.com>

	* slime.el: Various bits of support for maintaining multiple SLIME
	connections to different Lisp implementations simultaneously.

	* swank-backend.lisp (lisp-implementation-type-name): Add function to

	multi-connection functionality in slime.el.

2004-02-25  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* swank.lisp (format-arglist): Use a special pprint-dispatch table.

	* swank.lisp (format-arglist): Bind *PRINT-PRETTY* to NIL.
	(eval-in-emacs): Fix typo in docstring.

	* swank-cmucl.lisp (arglist-string): Bind *PRINT-PRETTY* to NIL.
	
2004-02-21  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	Add support for SERVE-EVENT based communication.
	
	* swank-sbcl.lisp (add-sigio-handler, remove-sigio-handlers):
	Renamed.
	(add-fd-handler, remove-fd-handlers): Implement interface.

	* swank-cmucl.lisp (fcntl): New function.
	(add-sigio-handler, remove-sigio-handlers): Renamed.
	(add-fd-handler, remove-fd-handlers): Implement interface.

	* swank.lisp (create-connection): Add support for fd-handlers.
	(install-fd-handler, deinstall-fd-handler): New functions.

	* swank-backend.lisp (add-sigio-handler): Renamed from
	add-input-handler.
	(remove-sigio-handlers): Renamed from remove-input-handlers.
	(add-fd-handler, remove-fd-handlers): New interface functions.

	* slime.el (slime-batch-test): Use sit-for instead of
	accept-process-output, so that we see something when swank gets
	compiled.  May be problematic in real batch mode.
	(loop-interrupt-continue-interrupt-quit): Wait a second before
	interrupting.  The signal seems to arrive before the evaluation
	request if don't wait => the endless loop is executed inside the
	debugger and sldb-quit will not be processed with fd-handlers.

	* swank.lisp (process-available-input): Move auxiliary function to
	toplevel.  Test if the stream is open.
	(install-sigio-handler): Handle the first request after installing
	the signal handler.

	* slime.el (slime-keys): Bind C-c C-x t to slime-list-threads and
	C-c C-x c to slime-list-connections.
	(slime): Disconnect before reconnecting if the inferior-lisp
	buffer wasn't renamed.

	buffer to remove old annotations.
	(slime-choose-overlay-region): Ignore errors in
	slime-forward-sexp.

2004-02-18  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* slime.el (slime): Just close the connection when called without
	prefix-argument.  Keeping the connection open doesn't make sense.
	We could ask if the Lisp process should be killed, though.
	(slime-maybe-close-old-connections): Delete unused function.
	(slime-start-swank-server): Use comint-send-string instead of
	comint-proc-query, 'cause I don't like Olin "100%" Shivers' code.
	(slime-init-output-buffer): Show some animations.
	(slime-repl-clear-output): Fixed.
	(slime-compilation-finished): It's not necessary to switch to the
	original buffer, because the buffer is encoded in the
	source-locations.
	(sldb-show-source): Don't raise an error if the source cannot be
	located.  Print a message instead, because errors in
	process-filters cause a 1 second delay.

	* swank-cmucl.lisp (read-into-simple-string): Workaround for
	read-sequence bug in 18e.

2004-02-18  Peter Seibel <peter@javamonkey.com>

	* swank-clisp.lisp: Update comments about metering package.

	* metering.lisp: Imported from CLOCC.  Suggested by Peter Seibel.

2004-02-17  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* swank.lisp, slime.el (make-compiler-note): Don't send the
	short-message across the wire if the slot is nil.

	* swank-cmucl.lisp (clear-xref-info): Compare the truenames with
	equalp instead of the unix-truenames.  The old version was very
	inefficient (clearing the tables with about 1000 entries required
	serveral seconds).
	(xref-context-derived-from-p, pathname=): Delete unused functions.

	* swank-clisp.lisp (remove-input-handlers):
	socket:socket-stream-handle is not available on Windows.
	Reported by Alan Shutko.

	* slime.el (slime-length>): New function.
	(slime-compiler-notes-to-tree): Don't collapse if there is only
	one kind of notes.

	* swank-clisp.lisp (set-sigio-handler, add-input-handler):
	Conditionalize for linux.

	* swank-backend.lisp (compile-system-for-emacs): Add default
	implementation.
	(compiler-condition): New slot short-message.

	* slime.el (slime-compilation-finished): Display compiler notes
	grouped by severity in a separate buffer.

	(slime-tree-for-severity, slime-compiler-notes-to-tree)
	(slime-compiler-notes-mode, slime-compiler-notes-quit): New
	functions.
	(with-struct, slime-tree): New code for pseudo tree widget.
	(slime-init-connection-state): Set slime-state-name to "".

2004-02-08  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* swank-cmucl.lisp (create-socket): Fix last fix.  Use the proper
	port argument.

	* swank-allegro.lisp, swank-backend.lisp, swank-clisp.lisp,
	swank-cmucl.lisp, swank-lispworks.lisp, swank-openmcl.lisp,
	swank-sbcl.lisp (create-socket): Take interface as argument.
	
	* slime.el (sldb-show-frame-details): Fix typos.

	(slime-test-find-definition, slime-test-complete-symbol)
	(slime-test-arglist): Add more slime-check-top-level calls.

	* swank.lisp (setup-server): Pass loopback-interface to
	create-socket.  Reported by Dirk Gerrits.
	(*loopback-interface*): New parameter.
	(sldb-loop): Send :debug event inside unwind-protect, so we never
	lose the corresponding :debug-return event.

2004-02-08  Marco Baringer  <mb@bese.it>

	* swank-openmcl.lisp (find-source-locations): Eliminate unused
	variable warning.

	* swank.lisp (swank-pprint): Bind pretty print vars to
	*swank-pprint-X* counter parts.
	(*swank-pprint-circle*, *swank-pprint-escape*,
	*swank-pprint-level*, *swank-pprint-length*): Swank counterparts
	to *print-X* variables used when swank needs to pretty print a
	form.
	(apply-macro-expander): Use swank-pprint.

2004-02-07  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	(slime-thread-goahead): Deleted.
	(slime-maybe-start-multiprocessing): Call
	swank:startup-multiprocessing.  Reported by Paolo Amoroso.

	* swank.lisp (dispatch-event): :debug, :debug-condition,
	:debug-activate events were all encoded as :debug events, which
	means the debugger never worked!  Fix it.  I guess no one uses
	SLIME with a multithreaded Lisp.
	(read-user-input-from-emacs): Flush the output before reading.
	(sldb-loop): Add a sldb-enter-default-debugger tag, so we can
	enter the default debugger by throwing to it.

	from a file).

	* swank.lisp (undefine-function): New function.
	(print-with-frame-label, print-part-to-string): Bind
	*print-circle* to t, to avoid unbound recursion when printing
	cyclic data structures.

	* slime.el (slime-undefine-function): New command.  Bound to C-c
	C-u.

2004-02-06  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* slime.el (sldb-setup): Offer to enter a recursive edit if there
	are pending continuations.  
	(slime-eval): Unwind the stack, thereby exititing recursive edits,
	before signaling the error.

2004-02-05  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* swank-openmcl.lisp (compile-system-for-emacs): Remove compile
	time dependency on ASDF.

	Kantrowitz's metering package.  Reporting needs to be
	refined (profile-package currently ignores callers-p and methods).

2004-02-04  Bryan O'Connor <bryan-slime@lunch.org>

	* swank-openmcl.lisp (mailbox): Use a semaphore instead of
	process-wait.  Works better with native threads.

2004-02-04  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* swank-backend.lisp (debugger-info-for-emacs): Export it.

	* swank-sbcl.lisp (add-input-handler): Use fcntl from the sb-posix
	package.
	
	* swank.lisp (sldb-loop, dispatch-event, send-to-socket-io): Send
	a :debug-activate event instead of a :debug event (to avoid
	sending a potentially long backtrace each time).
	(handle-sldb-condition): Include the thread-id in the message.

	* slime.el (slime-path): Use load-file-name as fallback.
	Suggested by Lawrence Mitchell.
	(slime-dispatch-event): Add support for :debug-activate event.
	(sldb-activate): New function.
	(sldb-mode): make-local-hook doesn't seem to work in Emacs 20.
	Use a buffer local variable instead.
	(slime-list-connections): Don't print Lisp's state.
	(slime-short-state-name): Deleted.
	
2004-02-02  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* slime.el (slime-debugger): The customization group is called
	'slime-debugger', fix referrers.  Reported by Jouni K Seppanen.

	detect missing initargs for the connection struct.  

2004-01-31  Jouni K Seppanen <jks@iki.fi>

	* slime.el (slime-path): Placed inside an eval-and-compile.  Works
	around some problems when byte-compiling slime-changelog-date.

2004-01-31  Marco Baringer  <mb@bese.it>

	* swank-openmcl.lisp: remove defslimefun-unimplemented forms.

	not contain an asdf system definition.
	
2004-01-31 Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	Merge stateless-emacs branch into main trunk.  We use now signal
	driven IO for CMUCL and one thread per request for multithreaded
	Lisps.

2004-01-31  Robert E. Brown <bbrown@speakeasy.net>

	* swank-backend.lisp, swank-sbcl.lisp,

2004-01-23  Alan Ruttenberg <alanr-l@mumble.net>

	* swank-openmcl.lisp: Bind ccl::*signal-printing-errors* to nil

	sldb-prefix.

	* swank-backend.lisp (return-from-frame, restart-frame):

	done in swank-sbcl.

	* swank-loader.lisp: Don't reference the swank package at
	read-time.

	* swank.lisp (completions): Never bind *package* to nil.  That's a
	type error in SBCL.
	(swank-debugger-hook): Flush the output streams and be careful
	when accessing *buffer-package*.  
	(create-swank-server): Return the port of the serve socket.

2004-01-20  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* slime.el (slime-complete-symbol): Insert the completed-prefix
	before deleting the original text to avoid troubles with left
	inserting markers.
	(slime-symbol-start-pos): Skip backward across symbol
	constituents.
	(slime-evaluating-state): [:read-sring] Save the window
	configuration.

	(slime-easy-menu): Added menu items:
	"Eval Region", "Scratch Buffer", "Apropos Package..."
	Added some bold to default SLDB faces.

2004-01-19  Alan Ruttenberg  <alanr-l@mumble.net>
        *swank-openmcl.lisp in frame-catch-tags, ppc32::catch-frame.catch-tag-cell -> 0,
	ppc32::catch-frame.csp-cell -> 3. FIXME when this code is more stable in openMCL.
	
2004-01-19  Michael Weber  <michaelw@foldr.org>

	* slime.el (slime-close-all-sexp): New command to close all

	* swank-openmcl.lisp (thread-id, thread-name): Fixed silly bugs
	(thanks Marco Baringer).

	to use `defimplementation'.

	* swank-backend.lisp (definterface, defimplementation): New macros
	as sugar around defgeneric/defmethod. This supports conveniently
	supplying a default (on NO-APPLICABLE-METHOD).  Because the
	underly mechanism is still generic functions this doesn't break
	code that isn't updated.
	(warn-unimplemented-interfaces): Print a list of backend functions
	that are not implemented.
	(xref and list-callers): Defined interfaces for these functions.
	(describe-definition): New function that takes over from the many
	other describe-* functions called from apropos listing. Takes the
	type of definition (as returned by describe-symbol-for-emacs) as
	an argument.

	* slime.el (sldb-enable-styled-backtrace): This is now true by
	default.
	(slime-keys): Bound `slime-inspect' to `C-c I'.
	(slime): `M-x slime' now offers to keep existing connections
	alive (else disconnect them). If you disconnect them, the new
	connection gets to reuse the existing REPL.
	(slime-connection): Error if the connection is closed.
	(slime-handle-oob): New message (:ED WHAT) for `slime-ed'.
	(slime-display-output-buffer): Don't pop up the REPL if it is
	already visible in any frame.
	(slime-find-asd): Handle case where (buffer-file-name) is nil.
	(slime-ed): Elisp backend for (CL:ED WHAT).
	(slime-apropos): Add a summary line to apropos listings.

	describe function) with `type' (argument to pass to unified
	swank:describe-definition function).
	(slime-apropos-package): New command on `C-c P'. Presents apropos
	listing for all external (with prefix also internal) symbols in a
	package.

	* swank-lispworks.lisp (sigint-handler): Bind a continue restart.
	(make-dspec-location): Handle strings like pathnames.
	Some multithreading support.

	* slime.el (compile-defun): Don't use keywords.  The keyword
	package is locked in Lispworks and causes the test-suite to hang.
	(slime-eval-with-transcript): Fix bug triggered when 'package' is
	a buffer local variable.  Reported by Janis Dzerins.
	(slime-batch-test): Wait until the connection is ready.

2004-01-18 Alan Ruttenberg  <alanr-l@mumble.net>

	* swank-openmcl: Implement frame-catch-tags. Added debugger functions 
	sldb-restart-frame, sldb-return-from-frame. Should probably be added to backend.lisp
	but let's discuss first. Do other lisps support this?
	
	* slime.el sldb-restart-frame, sldb-return-from-frame

2004-01-18  Wolfgang Jenkner  <wjenkner@inode.at>

	* swank-clisp.lisp (call-without-interrupts): Evaluate
	linux:SIGFOO at read time since the macro with-blocked-signals
	expects a fixnum.

2004-01-18  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* swank-sbcl.lisp (make-fn-streams): Deleted.  Already defined in
	swank-gray.lisp.

	* swank.lisp (find-symbol-or-lose, format-arglist): New functions.
	(without-interrupts): New macro.

	* swank-backend.lisp, swank-clisp.lisp, swank-lispworks.lisp,
	swank-openmcl.lisp, swank-sbcl.lisp, swank-allegro.lisp:
	(arglist-string): Refactor common code to swank.lisp.
	(call-without-interrupts, getpid): Are now generic functions.

	* slime.el (arglist): Test slot readers and closures.

	* swank-cmucl.lisp (arglist-string): Use
	pcl:generic-function-lambda-list for generic functions.  Handle
	closures.  Print arglist in lower case.
	(inspected-parts-of-value-cell): Was lost during the inspector
	refactoring.

2004-01-18  Wolfgang Jenkner  <wjenkner@inode.at>

	* swank-clisp.lisp (compile-file-for-emacs,
	split-compiler-note-line): Revert last change.
	(handle-notification-condition): Don't signal the condition.
	(*compiler-note-line-regexp*): Fix and rewrite it as extended
	regexp.

	* slime.el (slime-changelog-date): Use file-truename of
	byte-compile-current-file.
	
2004-01-17  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* slime.el (slime-format-arglist): Add some sanity checks and
	print zero argument functions nicer.  Suggested by Ivan Boldyrev.
	(slime-test-expect): Take test predicate as argument.
	(arglist): Test generic functions.

	* swank-cmucl.lisp (arglist-string): Handle generic functions
	better.  Reported by Ivan Boldyrev.

2004-01-16  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* swank-allegro.lisp: Multiprocessing support.

	* swank-openmcl.lisp, swank-cmucl.lisp, swank-backend.lisp,
	swank.lisp: Refactor inspector code.

	(create-swank-server): Patch by Marco Baringer <mb@bese.it>.
	Bring it back again.
	(create-connection): Use return the dedicated output stream if
	available.

	* slime.el: Numerous REPL related fixes.
	(slime-update-state-name): Take state as argument.
	(slime-repl-beginning-of-defun, slime-repl-end-of-defun): Fix
	typos.

	(from alanr).
	(with-io-redirection): Use (current-connection) instead of
	*dispatching-connection* (from alanr).

	* slime.el (slime-init-output-buffer): XEmacs portability fix, and
	use header-line-format to show info about Lisp in Emacs21.

2004-01-15  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* swank-sbcl.lisp, swank-cmucl.lisp (remove-input-handlers): New
	method.

	* swank-allegro.lisp (excl:stream-read-char-no-hang): Import it.
	(emacs-connected): Add default method.  The method for
	no-applicable-method doesn't seem to work.  ACL bug?

	* swank-loader.lisp (compile-files-if-needed-serially): Don't
	handle compilation errors.  We must compile everything because
	changelog-date requires *compile-file-truename*.

	* slime.el: (slime-changelog-date)
	(slime-check-protocol-version): New functions.
	(slime-handle-oob): Handle :check-protocol-version event.
	(slime-init-output-buffer): Print some info about the remote Lisp.
	(slime-connect): Use it.

	(slime-repl-show-result, slime-compile-file)
	(slime-show-evaluation-result): Insert output from eval commands
	after the prompt and asynchronous output before the prompt.  Needs
	documentation.
	(repl-test, repl-read, interactive-eval-output): New tests.
	(slime-flush-output): Accept output from all processes.

	* swank.lisp (serve-requests): New function.
	(setup-server): Use it.
	(start-server): Pass backgroud to setup-server.
	(create-connection): Check the protocol version.
	(changelog-date): New function.
	(make-output-function): Use write-string instead of princ.

	* swank-backend.lisp (remove-input-handlers): New function.

2004-01-15  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el (slime-aux-connect, slime-handle-oob): Support for
	(:open-aux-connection port) message where Lisp requests that
	Emacs make a connection. These are "auxiliary" connections which
	don't (or at least shouldn't) have their own REPL etc.

	* swank.lisp: New support for multiprocessing and multiple
	connections + commentary.
	(with-a-connection): Macro to execute some forms "with a
	connection". This is used in the debugger hook to automatically
	create a temporary connection if needed (i.e. if the current
	thread doesn't already have one).
	(open-aux-connection): Helper function to create an extra
	connection to Emacs.

	* swank-sbcl.lisp: Implemented multiprocessing. Not perfect.

	* swank-cmucl.lisp: Implemented new multiprocessing interface.
	(create-socket): Make FDs non-blocking when multiprocessing is
	enabled.
	(startup-multiprocessing): Set *swank-in-background* to :spawn.

	* swank-backend.lisp: Changed multiprocessing interface.

2004-01-15  Wolfgang Jenkner  <wjenkner@inode.at>

	* swank-clisp.lisp (with-blocked-signals): New macro.
	(without-interrupts): Use it.
	(*use-dedicated-output-stream*, *redirect-output*): Don't set them
	here, use the default settings.
	Make :linux one of *features* if we find the "LINUX" package.

2004-01-14  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* swank-openmcl.lisp (emacs-connected): Typo fix (missing
	close-paren).

2004-01-13  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* slime.el (slime-input-complete-p): Tolerate extra close parens.
	(slime-idle-state): Don't active the repl.
	(slime-insert-transcript-delimiter): Insert output before prompt.
	(slime-open-stream-to-lisp): Initialize the process-buffer with
	the connection buffer.
	(slime-repl-activate): Deleted.
	(slime-repl-eval-string, slime-repl-show-result)
	(slime-repl-show-abort): Better handling of abortion.
	(slime-compile-file): Insert output before prompt.

	* swank-lispworks.lisp (create-socket): Fix condition message.

	* swank-openmcl.lisp (*swank-in-background*): Set to :spawn.
	(emacs-connected): Initialize ccl::*interactive-abort-process*.

	* swank.lisp (*swank-in-background*): New variable.
	(start-server): Start swank in background, depending on
	*swank-in-background*.

	* swank-cmucl.lisp, swank-sbcl.lisp (*swank-in-background*): Set
	to :fd-handler.
	
	* swank-clisp.lisp (accept-connection): Remove superfluous call to
	socket-wait.

	New more direct socket interface.  The new interface is closer to
	the functions provided by the implementations.  For Lispworks we
	use some non-exported functions to get a sane interface.  The
	interface also includes add-input-handler and a spawn function
	(not used yet).  The idea is that most of the logic can be shared
	between similar backends.

	* swank-gray.lisp (make-fn-streams): New function.
	(stream-read-char-no-hang, stream-read-char-will-hang-p): Moved to
	here from swank-clisp.lisp.

	* swank-allegro.lisp, swank-clisp.lisp, swank-cmucl.lisp,
	swank-lispworks.lisp, swank-openmcl.lisp, swank-sbcl.lisp:
	(create-socket, local-port, close-socket, accept-connection)
	(add-input-handler, spawn): Implement new socket interface.

	* swank.lisp (start-server, open-dedicated-output-stream &etc):
	Use new socket functions.

	* swank-backend.lisp (create-socket, local-port, close-socket)
	(accept-connection, add-input-handler, spawn): New functions.
	(accept-socket/stream, accept-socket/run): Deleted.

2004-01-13  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* swank-clisp.lisp: Updated for new network interface but not
	tested! Probably slightly broken.

	* swank-lispworks.lisp: Updated for new network interface.
	(accept-socket/stream): This function is currently broken, so
	LispWorks can't use the dedicated output channel at the moment.

	* swank.lisp, swank-cmucl.lisp, swank-sbcl.lisp: Updated for new
	network interface.

	* swank-backend.lisp (accept-socket/stream, accept-socket/run):
	New functions replacing the ancient (over 24 hours!)
	`create-socket-server'. This interface is much simpler.

2004-01-12  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* swank-lispworks.lisp: Partially updated for new backend
	interface, but not actually working. The sockets code is broken, I
	haven't grokked LispWorks the interface properly.

	* swank-gray.lisp (slime-input-stream, slime-output-buffer): Added
	slots to support the new `make-fn-streams' interface from
	swank-backend.lisp. These slots need to be initialized by the
	backend, see swank-sbcl.lisp for an example (very easy).

	* swank-sbcl.lisp (create-socket-server): Implemented new server
	interface.

	* slime.el (slime-handle-oob): Added
	:open-dedicated-output-stream message, previously implemented
	with :%apply.
	(slime-repl-read-string, slime-repl-return-string): Pass integer
	argument to `slime-repl-read-mode' to set rather than toggle.

	* swank.lisp: Taking over previously non-portable jobs:
	(start-server): Now only uses sockets code from the backend.
	(handle-request): Top-level request loop.
	(open-dedicated-output-stream): Dedicated output socket.
	(connection): New data structure that bundles together the things
	that constitute a connection to Emacs: socket-level stream and
	user-level redirected streams.

	* swank-cmucl.lisp (create-socket-server): Generic TCP server
	driven by SERVE-EVENT.
	(serve-one-request, open-stream-to-emacs): Deleted. Now handled
	portably in swank.lisp.
	(make-fn-streams): Implement new stream-redirection interface.
	(slime-input-stream): New slot referencing output sibling, so it
	can be forced before input requests.

	* swank-backend.lisp (create-socket-server): Generic
	callback-driven TCP server interface. Replaces
	`create-swank-server', with the higher-level logic moved into
	swank.lisp.
	(emacs-connected): Invoked when Emacs initially connects, as a
	hook for backend implementations.
	(make-fn-streams): Interface for creating pairs of input/output
	streams that are backended by callback functions. Used to
	implement redirected-via-Emacs standard I/O streams.

2004-01-12  Lawrence Mitchell  <wence@gmx.li>

	* slime.el (slime-events-buffer): Set `hs-block-start-regexp'
	before running `hs-minor-mode'.

2004-01-10  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el (package-updating): Expected package is now a list (can
	be any), since the shortest nickname is not
	standardized. e.g. USER or CL-USER for COMMON-LISP-USER.

	* swank-cmucl.lisp: Don't enable xref (let the user decide).
	(set-fd-non-blocking): Removed unused function.
	Miscellaneous refactoring of the networking code.

	* slime.el (slime-complete-symbol): Use markers to hold the
	beginning and end of the completion prefix, in case looking up
	completions causes insertions (e.g. GC announcements).

2004-01-09  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el (slime-activate-state): Only update state name when
	`slime-default-connection' activates. This fixes an annoying
	"Selecting deleted buffer" bug that prevented SLIME from being
	restarted.
	(slime-next-connection): Fixed a bug where buffer-local connection
	bindings could get in the way and prevent the connection from
	actually changing.
	(slime-complete-restore-window-configuration): Wrap
	`set-window-configuration' in `save-excursion'. This fixes a
	problem where the cursor would end up in the wrong place after
	completion in XEmacs.

2004-01-09  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* slime.el: Place (require 'cl) inside a eval-and-compile.
	(slime-with-connection-buffer): Move definition upwards before the
	first use.
	(package-updateing): New test for package updates in the listeners.

	* swank.lisp (eval-region): Bind *package* outside the
	unwind-protect to detect updates.

	* swank-backend.lisp (debugger-info-for-emacs)
	(find-function-locations): Doc fix.

2004-01-09  Wolfgang Jenkner  <wjenkner@inode.at>

	* swank-clisp.lisp: Add methods for GRAY:STREAM-READ-CHAR-NO-HANG
	and for the CLISP specific GRAY:STREAM-READ-CHAR-WILL-HANG-P.
	This should fix the behaviour of SYS::READ-FORM.

2004-01-08  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el (slime-inspector-fontify): Function to insert a string
	in a particular inspector face. Replaces macro-code-generation
	function `slime-inspector-expand-fontify'. Fixes a byte-compile
	problem (macro was calling function not defined at compile-time).

2004-01-07  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>
	
	* slime.el: Multisession internal improvements. Now there are
	three separate connection variables, in order of priority:
	  slime-dispatching-connection (dynamically-bound)
	  slime-buffer-connection      (buffer-local)
	  slime-default-connection     (global)
	The most specific one available is used. This is splitting
	`slime-connection' into multiple variables, so that you can be
	specific about what you want to assign (i.e. know if you're
	setting a dynamic binding or a buffer-local one).
	Fixed some related bugs.
	(slime-connection-close-hook): If default connection closes,
	select another connection.
	(slime-lisp-package): Initially CL-USER nickname instead of
	COMMON-LISP-USER (for REPL prompt).

	* slime.el (slime): Multisession support: with prefix argument,
	gives the option of keeping existing sessions and firing up an
	additional *inferior-lisp* to connect to. Each connection now has
	its own *slime-repl[<n>]* buffer.
	(slime-connection): Should now be read via the function of the
	same name. The accessor will check if the value is NIL, and if so
	use `slime-default-connection'.
	(slime-default-connection): The connection that will be used by
	default, i.e. unless `slime-connection' is bound. Renamed from
	`slime-primary-connection'.
	(slime-init-connection-state): When reconnecting, update the
	`slime-connection' binding in the REPL to use the new connection.
	(slime-repl-input-history, ...): REPL variables are now
	buffer-local.

2004-01-06  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* swank.lisp (eval-string): New argument 'id'.  Used to identify
	the remote continuation.
	(log-event): New debugging function.
	(read-from-emacs, send-to-emacs): Use it.

	* slime.el: The new macro 'slime-rex' can now be used to evaluate
	sexps remotely.  It offers finer control what to do when the
	evaluation aborts.
	(slime-rex): New macro
	(slime-eval, slime-eval-async, sldb-continue)
	(sldb-invoke-restart): Use it.
	(slime-continuation-counter, slime-push-evaluating-state): New
	functions.
	(slime-output-buffer): Initialize markers.
	(sldb-mode): XEmacs doesn't like (add-hook (make-local-hook ...)).
	(slime-init-connection): New optional argument SELECT.
	(slime-def-connection-var): Workarounds for Emacs 20 reader bugs.
	Backquote is pretty broken Emacs 20.
	
2004-01-06  Ignas Mikalajunas <i.mikalajunas@mbt.lt>

	* swank-loader.lisp (user-init-file): Use merge-pathames.  Fix
	Windows support.

2004-01-05  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el: Multiple session support, i.e. Emacs can open
	multiple connections to Lisps. The guts is there, but
	user-interface is currently minimal.
	(slime-net-process): Replaced with slime-net-processes.
	(slime-net-send): Take process as argument.
	(slime-process-available-input): Poll all connections.
	(slime-connection): Current connection (process) to use for
	talking to Lisp. Can be bound dynamically or buffer-local.
	(slime-with-connection-buffer): Macro to enter the process-buffer
	of `slime-connection' to manipulate the local variables.
	(slime-stack-stack): Now buffer-local in the process-buffer of
	each connection.
	(slime-push-state, slime-pop-state): Operate on the stack inside
	`slime-connection's process-buffer.
	(slime-dispatch-event): Take optional process argument, to bind
	`slime-connection' appropriately when events arrive from the
	network.
	(slime-def-connection-var): Macro to define variables that are
	"connection-local". Such variables are used via (setf'able)
	accessor functions, and their real bindings exist as local
	variables in the process-buffers of connections. The accessors
	automatically work on `slime-connection'.
	(slime-lisp-features, slime-lisp-package, slime-pid, sldb-level):
	These variables are now connection-local.
	(slime-read-from-minibuffer): Inherit `slime-connection' as
	buffer-local so that we complete towards the right Lisp.
	(sldb-mode): Inherit `slime-connection' as buffer-local so that we
	debug towards the right Lisp.
	(get-sldb-buffer): New function to return (optionally create) the
	SLDB buffer for the current connection. Since multiple Lisps can
	be debugged simultaneously, the buffername now includes the
	connection number.
	(slime-connection-abort): New command to abort a connection
	attempt (don't use `slime-disconnect' anymore - that closes all
	connections).
	(slime-execute-tests): Honor `slime-test-debug-on-error'.
	(slime-next-connection): Cycle through open Lisp connections.

2004-01-02  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* slime.el (slime-display-output-buffer): Move the output markers
	to the end of the buffer.

	:name.
	(format-condition-for-emacs): Replaced with

	:validity property.
	
	* swank-cmucl.lisp (accept-loop, safe-definition-finding): Doc
	fix.
	(location-buffer=, file-xrefs-for-emacs)
	(sort-contexts-by-source-path, source-path<)
	(format-condition-for-emacs): Remove unused functions.
	(format-frame-for-emacs): Don't include the frame number in the
	description, but use the frame number for indentation. Update
	callers.
	(frame-locals): Rename the :symbol property to :name.
	
	* slime.el (slime-add-face): New function.
	(sldb-add-face): Use it.
	(sldb-setup): Some refactoring.
	(sldb-insert-condition): New function.  Factorized from
	sldb-setup.  Message and types are now separate.
	(sldb-insert-restarts): New function.  Factorized from sldb-setup.
	(sldb-insert-frame): Factorized from slime-insert-frames. The
	frame number in no longer part of the string describing the frame.
	(sldb-insert-frames): Use it.
	(sldb-show-frame-details): Print frame numbers.  Fix printing of
	catch tags.  Move to the start of the frame before at the
	beginning to get unfontified text properties.
	(sldb-inspect-condition): New command.
	(sldb-insert-locals): The :symbol property is now called :name.
	Fix locals with :id attribute.
	(slime-open-inspector): Fix the bugs I introduced last time.
	
	* swank.lisp (safe-condition-message): New function.
	(debugger-condition-for-emacs): Used to be

	condition message from the type description.  Update all backends
	accordingly.
	(print-with-frame-label): New function. 
	
	* slime.el (slime-hyperspec-lookup): New function.

2004-01-02  Wolfgang Jenkner <wjenkner@inode.at>

	* swank-clisp.lisp: New file.  Merged with Vladimir's version.

	* xref.lisp: New file.  Used by swank-clisp.

	* swank-loader.lisp (user-init-file): Add CLISP files.
	
	* swank.lisp (eval-region, tokenize-completion): Modify loops a
	bit to make CLISP happy.

	* swank-backend.lisp (with-compilation-hooks): Replace () with
	(&rest _) to make CLISP happy.

	* slime.el (slime-goto-source-location): Support for CLISP style
	line numbers. Split it up.
	(slime-goto-location-buffer, slime-goto-location-position): New
	functions.
	(slime-load-system): Use slime-display-output-buffer.
	(slime-repl-mode): Disable conservative scrolling. Not sure if it
	was a good idea.
	(sldb-insert-frames, sldb-show-frame-details, sldb-list-locals):
	Minor fixes.
	(sldb-insert-locals): Renamed from sldb-princ-locals.
	(sldb-invoke-restart): Use slime-eval instead of
	slime-oneway-eval, because interactive restarts may read input.
	(slime-open-inspector): Minor indentation fixes.
	(slime-net-output-funcall): Removed.  Was unused.

2003-12-19 Alan Ruttenberg <alanr-l@mumble.net>
	* slime.el 1.157
	fix bug in sldb-princ-locals I introduced when adding fonts to sldb
	
2003-12-19 Alan Ruttenberg <alanr-l@mumble.net>
	* swank-openmcl.lisp 1.42
	in request-loop register output stream to be periodically slushed per Gary Byer's email.
	* slime.el 1.156
	slime-goto-source-location. Sometimes source information is recorded but it isn't a standard "def"
	in that case, don't error out, just look for the most likely place for the definition. 
	
2003-12-19  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* null-swank-impl.lisp: Deleted this old file. See
	swank-backend.lisp instead.

2003-12-18 Alan Ruttenberg <alanr-l@mumble.net>
	* swank-openmcl.lisp 1.41
	in openmcl (break) now goes into slime debugger. 
	(setq swank:*break-in-sldb* nil) to disable that.
	
2003-12-17 Alan Ruttenberg <alanr-l@mumble.net>
        * slime.el 1.155
        Allow font choices for backtrack. Add group for customizing them: sldb.
	Whole thing is enabled with sldb-enable-styled-backtrace which is off by default, for now.
	Try
	 '(sldb-condition-face ((t (:foreground "DarkSlateGray" :weight bold))))
	 '(sldb-detailed-frame-line-face ((t (:foreground "brown" :weight bold :height 1.2))))
	 '(sldb-local-name-face ((t (:weight bold))))
	 '(sldb-restart-face ((t (:foreground "DarkBlue" :weight bold))))
	 '(sldb-restart-number-face ((t (:underline t :weight bold))))
	 '(sldb-restart-type-face ((t (:foreground "DarkSlateGrey" :weight bold))))
	 '(sldb-section-face ((t (:weight bold :height 1.2))))
	 '(sldb-selected-frame-line-face ((t (:foreground "brown" :weight bold :height 1.2))))
	 '(sldb-topline-face ((t (:foreground "brown" :weight bold :height 1.2))))

2003-12-17 Alan Ruttenberg <alanr-l@mumble.net>
        * slime.el 1.154
	Allow some face choices in the inspector. Try
	 '(slime-inspector-label-face ((t (:weight bold))))
	 '(slime-inspector-topline-face ((t (:foreground "brown" :weight bold :height 1.2))))
	 '(slime-inspector-type-face ((t (:foreground "DarkRed" :weight bold))))
	You can also set slime-inspector-value-face
	
2003-12-17 Alan Ruttenberg <alanr-l@mumble.net>

	* swank-openmcl.lisp 1.40
	Fix an error with frame-source-location-for-emacs when the
	function was a method-function.
	Defined method-source-location that handles this case. You can
	still end up looking at the wrong definition, as the protocol
	doesn't allow passing back the qualifiers and specializers to look
	up the correct one in the file

.	* swank-openmcl.lisp 1.39
	Allow you to continue after interrupting. 
	Properly set *swank-debugger-stack-frame* when interrupting.

	* slime.el 1.152
	sldb-continue now uses slime-oneway-eval
	
2003-12-17  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* slime.el: Better handling of asynchronous output.
	(slime-output-end): New variable.  Use this marker to insert
	output.  Insert asynchronous output inserted before the "input
	region" and before the prompt.
	(slime-show-last-output): Use it.
	(slime-repl-insert-prompt): Initialize it.
	(slime-last-output-start): Removed.
	(slime-flush-output): Increase delay to 20 usecs.
	(slime-with-output-end-mark): Renamed from
	slime-with-output-at-eob.  Insert a newline if needed.
	(slime-output-string, slime-repl-activate): Use it.
	(slime-repl-return): Ensure that slime-repl-input-end-mark points
	to a reasonable location.
	
2003-12-17  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* HACKING: New file summarising our way of working.

2003-12-16  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el (slime-lisp-preferred-package-nicknames): Removed. Not
	very interesting (and slightly broken) now that shortest-nicknames
	are automatically used.
	(slime-output-oneway-evaluate-request): New function to evaluate
	an expression for side-effects (without getting a
	result).
	(slime-idle-state): Handle new :emacs-evaluate-oneway.
	(slime-debugging-state): Handle :emacs-evaluate-oneway.
	(sldb-invoke-restart): Use slime-oneway-eval. This avoids pushing
	an evaluating state (which will be aborted, and print an unnecessary
	message saying so).
	(sldb-break-with-default-debugger): New command to break into the
	default TTY debugger. Bound to 'B' in *sldb*.
	(slime-read-string-state): Added :emacs-evaluate-oneway.

	* swank.lisp (invoke-nth-restart-for-emacs): Wrapper around
	INVOKE-NTH-RESTART that checks that Lisp and Emacs agree on the
	debug level. This detects and ignores old restart requests when
	several are sent at once (possible because of new oneway-eval
	feature).
	(oneway-eval-string): New function to evaluate a string without
	sending a result, and with *DEBUGGER-HOOK* bound to NIL. (The
	debugger hook is inhibited to avoid state conflicts.)

2003-12-15  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* swank-openmcl.lisp (ccl::*warn-if-redefine-kernel*): Support for
	interrupting the listener (by Alan Ruttenberg).

2003-12-15  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* swank.lisp *start-swank-in-background*: Set to t by default.

	* slime.el (slime-eval-last-expression-display-output): New
	command.  Bound to C-x M-e.  Suggested by Nicolas Neuss.
	(slime-display-output-buffer): New function.
	(slime-slime-compile-file): Use it.

2003-12-15  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* swank.lisp (*processing-rpc*, *multiprocessing-enabled*,
	*debugger-hook-passback*): New variables.
	(with-conversation-lock, with-I/O-lock): New macros.
	(read-next-form): Use with-I/O-lock.
	(send-to-emacs): Use with-I/O-lock.

	during RPC) and multiprocessing is enabled, suspend until
	acknowleged by Emacs.
	(install-global-debugger-hook): Install a SLIME-DEBUGGER-FUNCTION
	globally on *DEBUGGER-HOOK*.
	(startup-multiprocessing-for-emacs): Called to initialize multiprocessing.
	(eval-string): Dynamically set the *PROCESSING-RPC* flag.
	(eval-string): Nasty hack with *DEBUGGER-HOOK-PASSBACK* to
	install debugger hook. Temporary, I swear!
	(eval-region, shortest-package-nickname): Report the shortest
	package nickname to Emacs (for the REPL prompt). Patch from Marco
	Baringer.

	* swank-backend.lisp: Defined multiprocessing interface.

	* swank-cmucl.lisp: Implmemented the multiprocessing interface.

	* slime.el (slime-multiprocessing): When true, use
	multiprocessing in Lisp if available.
	(slime-global-debugger-hook): When true, globally set
	*debugger-hook* to use the SLIME debugger. For use with
	SERVE-EVENT and multiprocessing.
	(slime-handle-oob): Handle :AWAITING-GOAHEAD message from threads
	that have suspended to wait for Emacs's attention.
	(slime-give-goahead): New command to allow a suspended thread to
	continue (bound to RET in the thread-control-panel).
	(slime-thread-control-panel): New command to display a buffer
	showing all threads that are suspending waiting for Emacs's
	attention. Bound to `C-c C-x t'.
	(slime-popup-thread-control-panel): When true, automatically
	popup the thread-control buffer when a new thread suspends.

2003-12-14  Alan Ruttenberg <alanr-l@mumble.net>

	* swank-openmcl.lisp (eval-in-frame, inspect-object and friends):
	Most of this is copied from swank-cmucl. The parts between &&&&&
	are what I added for openmcl. I piggyback off the inspector which
	is shipped with openmcl, so inspecting won't look the same as it
	would in cmucl, I imagine. Still, it's a start.  eval in frame
	uses frame-locals to get bindings so if you have debug settings
	low or don't have *save-local-symbols* set you won't be able to
	evaluate.
		
2003-12-14  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* swank-lispworks.lisp (tracedp, toggle-trace-fdefinition): Moved
	to swank.lisp.

	* swank-allegro.lisp (create-swank-server): Add support for
	BACKGROUND and CLOSE argument.
	(call-with-debugging-environment): Use excl::int-newest-frame to
	avoid the kludge with *break-hook*.
	(sldb-abort): New function.
	(frame-source-location-for-emacs): Dummy definition.
	(compile-file-for-emacs): The argument is called
	:load-after-compile and not :load.
	(xref-results-for-emacs): Use dolist instead of loop.

	BACKGROUND and CLOSE argument.
	(open-stream-to-emacs): Support for dedicated output stream.

	* swank.lisp: *start-swank-in-background*,
	*close-swank-socket-after-setup*, *use-dedicated-output-stream*:
	Moved here from swank-cmucl.
	(sldb-continue): Don't pass the condition as argument, because
	that doesn't work with Allegro.
	(toggle-trace-fdefinition, tracedp): Replace backend specific code
	with portable, but ugly, calls to eval.

	* swank-cmucl.lisp (compile-system-for-emacs): Add method for
	CMUCL.

	* slime.el (slime-goto-source-location): Better regexp for package
	qualified symbols.  Allow dashes in the name and two colons.

	thread.  Patch by Alan Ruttenberg.  Not yet enabled, due to lack
	of test platform.

	Alan Ruttenberg.
	Remove #' from lambdas.

2003-12-12  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* swank-cmucl.lisp (create-swank-server): New keyword arguments to
	control the server: BACKGROUND and CLOSE.  fd-handlers are used if
	BACKGROUND is true.  If close CLOSE is true, close the socket
	after the first connection; keep it open otherwise.
	*start-swank-in-background*, *close-swank-socket-after-setup*: The
	default values of the corresponding arguments for
	create-swank-server.
	(compile-file-for-emacs): Don't load the fasl-file when the
	compilation failed.

	* swank-openmcl.lisp (toggle-trace-fdefinition, tracedp):
	Implement trace command.  Patch by Alan Ruttenberg.
	(find-function-locations, find-source-locations): Handle
	variables, and method-combinations.  General cleanups.
	(source-info-first-file-name): Removed.
	(list-callers): Fixed.
	(list-callers): Fixed some more.  method-name is not exported in
	0.14.  From Marco Baringer.
	(swank-accept-connection): Accept multiple connections.  Patch by

	multi-line strings to one-liners by replacing any newline
	followed by indentation by a single space.
	(slime-xrefs-for-notes): Use it.

2003-12-11  Daniel Barlow  <dan@telent.net>

	* swank-sbcl.lisp (compiler-note-location): replace with
	thinly-ported version from the CMUCL backend which understands
	:lisp as a pathname

	* slime.el (slime-xrefs-for-notes): a little more temporary
	variables, a little less cdr.  Should be slightly faster on
	big systems
	(slime-goto-next-xref): set window point as well as buffer point -
	now works in GNU Emacs 21.2.1

	* slime.el (slime-find-asd, slime-load-system): new command
	to compile and load an ASDF system with all the usual compiler
	notes and stuff
	(slime-compilation-finished): if more than one file has new 
	errors/notes, create an xref buffer to show them all
	(slime-remove-old-overlays): bug fix: now removes overlays even
	at start of buffer

2003-12-10  Daniel Barlow  <dan@telent.net>

	* swank-sbcl.lisp (serve-request): more fiddling with serve-event
	descriptors

	* slime.el (slime-repl-return): slime-check-connected, otherwise

2003-12-08  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* swank-cmucl.lisp (*debug-definition-finding*): Now nil by
	default, so that errors while looking for definitions are printed
	as a message and not debugged.

	* slime.el (slime-read-from-minibuffer): Now the only

2003-12-07  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* swank-sbcl.lisp (function-source-location-for-emacs): return a
	list of source locations (one per method) when the request is
	for a GF.  This seems to make the elisp side popup a window
	to let the user select one.  Cool.

	* swank-[cmucl,sbcl,openmcl,lispworks].lisp (invoke-nth-restart):

	before printing an autodoc message (default 0.2 secs).

	typeout frame unless it already exists. Suitable to run on
	slime-mode-hook if you always want to have a typeout window.
	(slime-log-events): When nil, don't log events to

	starting SLIME under XEmacs. Still investigating..

	who-xxx functions.  Support for byte-compiled stuff.
	(code-location-stream-position): Try to be clever is the source
	path doesn't match the form.
	(call-with-debugging-environment): Bind *print-readably* to nil.

	* swank-lispworks.lisp: Use the new format for source
	locations. Implement the find-function-locations.
	(list-callers, list-callers): New functions.

	* swank-sbcl.lisp, swank-openmcl.lisp: Use the new format for
	source locations and implement find-function-locations (just calls
	the old code).

2003-11-29  Daniel Barlow  <dan@telent.net>

	* swank-sbcl.lisp (source-location-for-emacs):
	sb-debug::print-description-to-string takes only two args, not
	three.  Now 'v' command works in sldb :-)

	* slime.el (slime-idle-state): added :debug as a valid transition

	* swank.lisp (slime-debugger-function): New.  Returns a function
	suitable for use as the value of *DEBUGGER-HOOK* to install the
	SLIME debugger globally.  Must be run from the *slime-repl* buffer
	or somewhere else that the slime streams are visible so that it
	can capture them.  e.g. for Araneida:
	PKG> (setf araneida:*restart-on-handler-errors* 
	           (swank:slime-debugger-fucntion))

2003-11-29  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* slime.el: Some tweaking to the REPL.  slime-repl-input-end-mark
	is now always left inserting and slime-mark-input-end
	"deactivates" the end mark by moving it to the beginning of the
	buffer.
	(slime-goto-source-location): Next try for more uniform
	source-locations.  A source-location is now a structure with a
	"buffer-designator" and  "position-designator".  The buffer-designator
	open the file or buffer and the position-designator moves point to the
	right position.
	(slime-autodoc-mode): New command.
	(slime-find-fdefinitions): Experimental support for generic functions
	with methods.
	(slime-show-xrefs, slime-insert-xrefs, slime-goto-xref): Rewritten to
	work with more general source locations.

	* swank.lisp: Structure definitions for source-locations.
	(alistify, location-position<, group-xrefs): Utilities for xref
	support.

	* swank-cmucl.lisp (code-location-source-location): Renamed from
	safe-source-location-for-emacs.
	(code-location-from-source-location): Renamed from
	source-location-for-emacs.
	(find-fdefinitions, function-source-locations): New functions.
	(safe-definition-finding): New macro.

	* swank-lispworks.lisp: Xref support.
	(make-dspec-location): Updated for the new source-location format.

2003-11-29  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el (complete-symbol, arglist): Updated test cases for new
	completion interface.

2003-11-28  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el (slime-complete-symbol): Use the new completion
	support from the Lisp side. Don't obscure minibuffer input with
	completion messages.

	* completer.el: Dead and buried! Replaced by half a page of Common
	Lisp. Thanks Bill Clementson for a motivational and well-deserved
	taunt.

	* swank.lisp (longest-completion): Compute the best partial
	completion for Emacs.

	* slime.el (slime-swank-port-file): Try (temp-directory),
	temporary-file-directory, or "/tmp/", depending on what
	is (f)bound.

2003-11-28  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* swank-lispworks.lisp (make-dspec-location): Handle logical
	pathnames.  Reported by Alain Picard.

	* swank-sbcl.lisp, swank-cmucl.lisp: Support for output
	redirection to an Emacs buffer via a dedicated network stream.
	Can be enabled with *use-dedicated-output-stream*.

	* swank.lisp (slime-read-string, eval-string): Flush *emacs-io*.
	(eval-in-emacs): New function.

	* slime.el: Support for output from a dedicated socket.
	(slime-open-stream-to-lisp, slime-output-filter): New functions.
	Reorganized REPL code a bit.
	(slime-input-complete-p): Use vanilla forward-sexp, because
	slime-forward-sexp sometimes caused endless loops.
	(slime-disconnect): Close the output-stream-connection if present.
	(slime-handle-oob): A new :%apply event.  Executes arbitrary code;
	useful for bootstrapping.
	(slime-flush-output): New function.
	(slime-symbol-end-pos): Didn't work at all in Emacs20.  Just use
	point until someone commits a proper fix.
	Various uses of display-buffer: The second argument is different in
	XEmacs.
	(interrupt-bubbling-idiot): Reduce the timeout to 5 seconds.
	
2003-11-27  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el (slime-swank-port-file): Use `temporary-file-directory'
	instead of hardcoding "/tmp/".

2003-11-27  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* swank-lispworks.lisp: New backend.
	
	* slime.el (slime-with-output-to-temp-buffer): Save the window
	configuration in a buffer local variable instead on a global
	stack.
	(slime-show-last-output): Behavior customizable with
	slime-show-last-output-function.  Various tweaking for better
	multi-frame support.

	* swank-backend.lisp: List exported symbols explicitly.

	* swank-cmucl.lisp (function-source-location): Better support for
	generic functions.

	* swank.lisp (briefly-describe-symbol-for-emacs): Don't return
	unbound symbols.
	(describe-symbol, describe-function): Support package-qualified
	strings.

	* swank-loader.lisp: *sysdep-pathnames*: Add Lispworks files.
	(compile-files-if-needed-serially): Compile all files in a
	compilation unit.

2003-11-27  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el (slime-complete-symbol): Make a bogus alist out of the
	completion set, for compatibility with XEmacs.

	* completer.el: Stolen^Wimported from ILISP version 1.4. This is
	one revision prior to their latest, where they added a (require)
	for some other ILISP code. I backed down a revision to make it
	stand-alone, but this may mean that putting SLIME in the load-path
	before ILISP will break ILISP. So, beware.
	(completer-message): Cut dependency on undefined ilisp constant
	testing for xemacs.

2003-11-27  Zach Beane  <xach@xach.com>

	* swank.lisp (completions): Complete compound symbols (see below).

	* slime.el (slime-complete-symbol): Use `completer' package to
	handle more sophisticated completions. This includes abbreviations
	like "m-v-b" => "multiple-value-bind". It also (somewhat scarily)
	redefines other standard Emacs completion functions with similar
	capabilities. See commentary in completer.erl for details.

2003-11-25  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el (slime-make-typeout-frame): New command to create a
	frame where commands can print messages that would otherwise go to
	the echo area.
	(slime-background-message): Function for printing "background"
	messages. Uses the "typeout-frame" if it exists.
	(slime-arglist): Print arglist with `slime-background-message'.
	(slime-message): Use typeout frame if it exists, but only for
	multi-line messages.

2003-11-25  Daniel Barlow  <dan@telent.net>

	* swank-sbcl.lisp: delete big chunk of leftover commented-out 
	code

	* slime.el: arglist command to use slime-read-symbol-name,
	not slime-read-symbol

	* README: Minor updates for currency

2003-11-24  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* swank-backend.lisp (compiler-condition): Removed use of
	:documentation slot option. That is not portable (to CMUCL 18e).

	* swank.lisp (eval-string-in-frame): Fixed symbol-visibility
	problem (thanks Lawrence Mitchell).

	* swank-sbcl.lisp (function-source-location): Use TRUENAME to
	resolve source file name (thanks Lawrence Mitchell).

	* slime.el (slime-goto-source-location): Fixes when finding
	definition by regexp: open the right file (was missed), and
	tweaked regexp to match more 'def' forms - especially
	`defmacro-mundanely' (hyphen wasn't allowed before).

2003-11-23  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el (sldb-fetch-more-frames): Call swank:backtrace instead
	of (renamed) swank:backtrace-for-emacs.

	* swank-cmucl.lisp, swank-sbcl.lisp, swank-openmcl-lisp: Updated
	to use new debugger interfaces in swank-backend.lisp.

	* swank-backend.lisp (backtrace, eval-in-frame, frame-catch-tags,
	frame-locals, frame-source-location-for-emacs): More interface
	functions.

	* slime.el (slime-goto-source-location): Added optional `align-p'
	argument for :file and :emacs-buffer location types. This is for
	OpenMCL - unlike CMUCL its positions are not character-accurate so
	it needs to be aligned to the beginning of the sexp.
	(slime-connect): Don't delete a random window when *inferior-lisp*
	isn't visible.

	* swank-cmucl.lisp: Tidied up outline-minor-mode structure and
	added comments and docstrings.

	* swank-cmucl.lisp, swank-sbcl.lisp, swank-openmcl-lisp: Updated
	to use new debugger interface in swank-backend.lisp.

	* swank-backend.lisp (call-with-debugging-environment,
	sldb-condition, debugger-info-for-emacs): More callbacks defined.

	* swank.lisp: Tidied up outline-minor-mode structure, added
	comments and docstrings.
	(sldb-loop): Took over the main debugger loop.

	* swank-openmcl.lisp: Updated after refactoring of other backends
	(was broken).

	* slime.el (slime-goto-source-location): Align at beginning of
	sexp after (:file name pos) and (:emacs-buffer buffer pos).

	* swank-sbcl.lisp (describe-symbol-for-emacs): Don't ask for
	(documentation SYM 'class), CLHS says there isn't any 'class
	documentation (and SBCL warns).

	* swank.lisp, swank-cmucl.lisp, swank-sbcl.lisp: Refactored
	interface through swank-backend.lisp for: swank-compile-file,
	swank-compile-string, describe-symbol-for-emacs (apropos),
	macroexpand-all, arglist-string.

	* swank-backend.lisp: New file defining the interface between
	swank.lisp and the swank-*.lisp implementation files.

2003-11-22  Brian Mastenbrook  <bmastenb@cs.indiana.edu>

	* swank.asd: ASDF definition to load "swank-loader.lisp". This is
	useful for starting the Swank server in a separate Lisp and later
	connecting with Emacs. The file includes commentary.

2003-11-22  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el (slime-connect): Slightly reordered some window
	operations to ensure that *slime-repl* is popped up after `M-x
	slime-connect'.
	(slime-show-last-output): If the *slime-repl* buffer is already
	visible in any frame, don't change anything.

	* swank.lisp (listener-eval): Format results in *buffer-package*.
	Exporting (CREATE-SWANK-SERVER <port>). This function can be
	called directly to start a swank server, which you can then
	connect to with `M-x slime-connect'. It takes a port number as
	argument, but this can be zero to use a random available port.
	The function always returns the actual port number being used.

2003-11-19  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* swank.lisp: Better printing off return values.  In the REPL
	buffer we print now every value in a separate line and in the echo
	area separated by a comma.  We also print "; No value" for the
	degenerated case (values).  A new variable *sldb-pprint-frames*
	controls the printing of frames in the debugger. (Thanks Raymond
	Toy for the suggestions.)

	* swank-cmucl.lisp (format-frame-for-emacs): Bind *pretty-print*
	to *sldb-pprint-frames*.

	* slime.el: Window configuration are now saved on a stack, not in
	a single global variable.
	(slime-with-output-to-temp-buffer) We use now our own version of
	with-output-to-temp-buffer.  The default version is painfully
	incompatible between Emacs versions.  The version selects the
	temporary buffer and the behaivor of "q" is now more consistent
	(as suggested by Jan Rychter).
	(slime-connect): Hide the *inferior-lisp-buffer* when we are
	connected.  
	sldb-mode-map: Bind n and p to sldb-down and sldb-up.
	(slime-edit-fdefinition-other-window): New function. Suggested by
	Christian Lynbech.
	
	* swank-loader.lisp (user-init-file): There is now a user init
	file (~/.swank.lisp).  It is loaded after the other files.

2003-11-16  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* slime.el: [slime-keys] Override C-c C-r with slime-eval-region
	 (reported by Paolo Amoroso).
	
	* swank-loader.lisp: Compile and load gray stream stuff for SBCL
	and OpenMCL.

	* swank-openmcl.lisp, swank-sbcl.lisp: Import gray stream symbols.
	(without-interrupts*): New function.

	* swank.lisp (send-to-emacs): Protect the write operations by a
	without-interrupts, so that we don't trash the *cl-connection*
	buffer with partially written messages.

	* swank-cmucl.lisp (without-interrupts*): New function.

	* swank-gray.lisp (stream-write-char): Don't flush the buffer on
	newlines.

	* slime.el: Add some docstring.
	(interrupt-bubbling-idiot): New test.
	[slime-keys]:  Don't bind "\C- ".  Problematic on LinuxPPC.

2003-11-15  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* slime.el: Some tweaking for better scrolling in the *slime-repl*
	buffer (suggested by Jan Rychter).
	(slime-compile-file): Display the output buffer at the beginning.
	(slime-show-last-output): Include the prompt so that window-point
	is updated properly.
	(slime-with-output-at-eob): Update window-point if the buffer is
	visible.
	(slime-state/event-panic): Include the *slime-events* and
	*cl-connection* buffers in the report.

	* swank-cmucl.lisp (sos/out): Don't flush the buffer on newlines.

2003-11-13  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* slime.el: Imititate an "output-mark".  Output from Lisp should
	move point only if point is at the end of the buffer. (Thanks
	William Halliburton for the suggestion.)
	(slime-with-output-at-eob): New function.
	(slime-output-string, slime-repl-maybe-prompt): Use it.

	slime-repl-mode-map: Override "\C-\M-x". 

	An experimental scratch buffer:
	(slime-eval-print-last-expression): New function.
	(slime-scratch-mode-map, slime-scratch-buffer,
	 slime-switch-to-scratch-buffer, slime-scratch): New functions.

	* swank-cmucl.lisp (resolve-location): Emacs buffer positions are
	1 based.  Add 1 to the 0 based file-position.

2003-11-13  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el (slime-connect): pop-to-buffer into *slime-repl* when
	we connect.

2003-11-13  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* slime.el, swank-cmucl.lisp, swank-sbcl.lisp, swank-openmcl: New
	representation for "source-locations".  Compiler notes have now a
	message, a severity, and a source-location field.  Compiler notes,
	edit-definition, and the debugger all use now the same
	representation for source-location.  CMUCL does the source-path to
	file-position translation at the Lisp side.  This works better
	with reader macros, in particular with backquote.  The SBCL
	backend still does the translation on the Emacs side.  OpenMCL
	support is probably totally broken at the moment
 	
2003-11-13  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el (slime-repl-previous-input, slime-repl-next-input):
	When partial input has already been entered, the M-{p,n} REPL
	history commands only match lines that start with the
	already-entered prefix. This is comint-compatible behaviour which
	has been requested. The history commands also skip over line
	identical to the one already entered.
	(slime-complete-maybe-restore-window-confguration): Catch errors,
	so that we don't cause `pre-command-hook' to be killed.
	(slime-truncate-lines): If you set this to nil, slime won't set
	`truncate-lines' in buffers like sldb, apropos, etc.

2003-11-12  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el (slime-show-description): XEmacs portability: don't use
	`temp-buffer-show-hook'.
	(slime-inspect): Use `(slime-sexp-at-point)' as default inspection
	value (thanks Jan Rychter).

2003-11-10  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el (slime-post-command-hook): Inhibit unless (still) in
	slime-mode. Only call `slime-autodoc-post-command-hook' when
	`slime-autodoc-mode' is non-nil.
	(slime-setup-command-hooks): Use `make-local-hook' instead of
	`make-local-variable'.

2003-11-08  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* slime.el: slime-highlight-face: Use the :inherit attribute if
	possible.
	(slime-face-inheritance-possible-p): New function.

	* slime.el (slime-repl-return): Only send the current input to
	Lisp if it is a complete expression, like inferior-slime-return.

	* swank.lisp (completions): Use *buffer-package* if no other
	package is given.

	* slime.el: Remove the non-working face inheriting stuff.
	Hardcode colors for slime-highlight-face and specify the :inherit
	attribute for slime-repl-output-face.  So Emacs21 will do the
	right thing and the others get at least a customizable face.

	* slime.el (slime-buffer-package): Try to find be the
	package name before resorting to slime-buffer-package.  Return nil
	and not "CL-USER" if the package cannot be determined.
	(slime-goto-location): Insert notes with a source path, but
	without filename or buffername, at point.  This can happen for
	warnings during macro expansion. (The macro expander is a
	interpreted function and doesn't have a filename or buffername.)
	(slime-show-note): Display 2 double quotes "" in the echo area for
	zero length messages.  SERIES tends to signal warnings with zero
	length messages.
	(slime-print-apropos): Add support for alien types.

	* swank-cmucl.lisp (briefly-describe-symbol-for-emacs): Add
	support for alien types.
	(source-path-file-position): Read the entire expression with a
	special readtable.  The readtable records source positions for
	each sub-expression in a hashtable.  Extract the sub-expression
	for the source path from the read object and lookup the
	sub-expression in the hashtable to find its source position.

	* swank-sbcl.lisp (swank-macroexpand-all): Implemented.

2003-11-06  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el (slime-autodoc-mode): When non-nil, display the
	argument list for the function-call near point each time the point
	moves in a slime-mode buffer. This is a first-cut; more useful
	context-sensitive help to follow (e.g. looking up variable
	documentation).
	(slime-autodoc-cache-type): Cache policy "autodoc" documentation:
	either nil (no caching), 'last (the default - cache most recent
	only), or 'all (cache everything on symbol plists forever).

	* slime.el: Convenience macros:
	(when-bind (var exp) &rest body)
	  => (let ((var exp)) (when var . body))
	(with-lexical-bindings (var1 ...) . body)
	  => (lexical-let ((var1 var1) ...) . body)

	* slime.el (slime, slime-lisp-package): Reset `slime-lisp-package'
	(the REPL package) when reconnecting.
	(slime-buffer-package): Return `slime-lisp-package' when the
	major-mode is `slime-repl-mode'.

2003-11-04  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* slime.el (slime-read-string-state): Add support for evaluation
	requests.
	(slime-repl-read-break): New command.
	alternative.
	slime-keys: XEmacs cannot rebind C-c C-g.  Use C-c C-b as an
	alternative.
	(slime-selector): XEmacs has no prompt argument for read-char.
	(slime-underline-color, slime-face-attributes): Make face
	definitions compatible with XEmacs and Emacs20.
	(slime-disconnect): Delete the buffer of the socket.
	(slime-net-connect): Prefix the connection buffer name with a
	space to avoid accidental deletion.

	* swank.lisp (slime-read-string): Send a :read-aborted event for
	non-local exits.
	(case-convert): Handle :invert case better.

2003-11-03  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* slime.el (slime-display-message-or-view,
	slime-remove-message-window): Display too long lines in a new
	window.  Add a temporary pre-command-hook to remove the multiline
	window before the next command is executed.

	(slime-complete-symbol): Save the window configuration before
	displaying the completions and try to restore it later.  The
	configuration is restored when: (a) the completion is unique (b) there
	are no completion.  It is also possible to delay the restoration until
	(c) certain characters, e.g, space or a closing paren, are inserted.

	(slime-selector): Don't abort when an unkown character is pressed;
	display a message and continue.  Similiar for ?\?.  Add a selector for
	the *sldb* buffer.

	(slbd-hook, sldb-xemacs-post-command-hook): Emulate Emacs'
	point-entered text property with a post-command hook.

	* swank.lisp (case-convert, find-symbol-designator): New
	functions.

	* swank-cmucl.lisp, swank-openmcl.lisp, swank-sbcl.lisp
	(arglist-string): Don't intern the function name.  Use
	find-symbol-designator instead.

2003-11-03  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el (slime-display-buffer-region): Hacked to fix completely
	inexplicable XEmacs problems.

2003-11-2  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* null-swank-impl.lisp, swank-cmucl.lisp, swank-openmcl.lisp,
	swank.lisp: Input redirection works now on the line level, like a
	tty.  Output streams are now line buffered.  We no longer compute
	the backtrace-length.

	* slime.el:
	(slime-repl-read-mode, slime-repl-read-string, slime-repl-return,
	slime-repl-send-string, slime-read-string-state,
	slime-activate-state): Reorganize input redirection.  We no longer
	work on the character level but on a line or region; more like a
	terminal.  This works better, because REPLs and debuggers are
	usually written with a line buffering tty in mind.
	(sldb-backtrace-length, slime-debugging-state,
	slime-evaluating-state, sldb-setup, sldb-mode, sldb-insert-frames,
	sldb-fetch-more-frames): Don't use backtrace-length.  Computing
	the length of the backtrace is (somewhat strangely) an expensive
	operation in CMUCL, e.g., it takes >30 seconds to compute the
	length when the yellow zone stack guard is hit.

2003-11-02  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el (slime-log-event): Added a *slime-events* buffer
	recording all state machine events. The buffer uses hideshow-mode
	to fold messages down to single lines.
	(slime-show-source-location): Bugfix: only create source-highlight
	overlay if the source was actually located.
	(slime-selector): Renamed from `slime-select' because that
	function name was already in use. Ooops!

	* swank.lisp (eval-string): force-output on *slime-output* before
	returning the result. This somewhat works around some trouble
	where output printed by lisp is being buffered too long.

	* slime.el (slime-lisp-package-translations): Association list of
	preferred package nicknames, for the REPL prompt. By default maps
	COMMON-LISP->CL and COMMON-LISP-USER->CL-USER.

2003-11-01  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el (slime-select): Added an extensible "Select" command,
	which I gather is a LispM/Martin-Cracauer knock-off. When invoked,
	the select command reads a single character and uses that to
	decide which buffer to switch to. New characters can be defined,
	and the currently availables ones can be seen with '?'. I have not
	assigned a key to Select, because it seems like a command that
	should have a global binding. I would suggest `C-c s'.

	* swank.lisp (*slime-features*): Variable remembering the FEATURES
	list.
	(sync-state-to-emacs): Update Emacs about any state changes -
	currently this just means changes to the FEATURES list.
	(eval-string): Call `sync-state-to-emacs' before sending result.
	(eval-region): With optional PACKAGE-UPDATE-P, if the evaluation
	changes the current package, tell Emacs about the new package.
	(listener-eval): Tell `eval-region' to notify Emacs of package
	changes, so that e.g. (in-package :swank) does the right thing
	when evaluated in the REPL.

	* slime.el (slime-repl-output-face, slime-repl-input-face): Face
	definitions for output printed by Lisp and for previous REPL user
	inputs, respectively. Defaulting the input face to bold rather
	than underline, because it looks better on multi-line input.
	(slime-handle-oob): Two new out-of-band messages
	(:new-features FEATURES) and (:new-package PACKAGE-NAME). These
	are used for Lisp to tell Emacs about changes to *FEATURES* and
	*PACKAGE* when appropriate.
	(slime-same-line-p): Better implementation (does what the name
	suggests).
	(slime-lisp-package): New variable keeping track of *PACKAGE* in
	Lisp -- or at least, the package to use for the REPL.
	(slime-repl-insert-prompt): The prompt now includes the package
	name.
	(slime-repl-bol): C-a in the REPL now stops at the prompt.
	(slime-repl-closing-return): C-RET & C-M-m now close all open
	lists and then send input in REPL.
	(slime-repl-newline-and-indent): C-j in REPL is now better with
	indentation (won't get confused by unmatched quotes etc appearing
	before the prompt).

2003-11-1  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* slime.el (slime-debugging-state): Save the window configuration
	in a state variable.  
	sldb-saved-window-configuration: Removed.
	(slime-repl-mode): Use conservative scrolling.
	(slime-repl-insert-prompt): Set window-point after the prompt.
	(slime-repl-add-to-input-history): Don't add subsequent duplicates to
	the history.

	* swank.lisp (slime-read-char): Flush the output before reading.
	(listener-eval): Like eval region but set reader variables (*, **,
	*** etc.)

	* swank-openmcl.lisp, swank-sbcl.lisp: Implement stream-line-column.

	* swank-cmucl.lisp (slime-input-stream-misc-ops): Renamed from
	slime-input-stream-misc.

2003-10-31  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el (slime-repl-mode-map): Bound `slime-interrupt' on both
	C-c C-c and C-c C-g.

	* swank.lisp (interactive-eval): Evaluate in *buffer-package*.

	* slime.el: Tweaked debugger window management somewhat: the
	window configuration is saved when the debugger is first entered
	and then restored when the idle state is reached.

2003-10-31  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* slime.el: (slime-repl-read-mode, slime-repl-read-xxx): New minor
	mode for stream character based input to Lisp.

	* swank.lisp: *read-input-catch-tag*, take-input, slime-read-char:
	Moved here from swank-cmucl.lisp.
	(defslimefun, defslimefun-unimplemented): Move macro definitions to
	the beginning of the file.

	* swank-cmucl.lisp: (slime-input-stream, slime-input-stream-read-char,
	lime-input-stream-misc): Character input stream from Emacs.
	(slime-input-stream/n-bin): Removed.

	* swank-openmcl.lisp, swank-sbcl.lisp: Gray stream based input
	redirection from Emacs.
	
2003-10-29  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* slime.el:
	Beginnings of a REPL-mode.
	Minor debugger cleanups.

	* swank.lisp:
	slime-read-error: New condition.
	(read-next-form): Re-signal the conditions as slime-read-errors.  And
	check the result of read-sequence (i.e. detect CMUCL's read-sequence
	bug).
	(sldb-continue, throw-to-toplevel): Was more or less the same in all
	backends.

	* swank-openmcl.lisp, swank-sbcl.lisp, swank-cmucl.lisp:
	(serve-request): Handle slime-read-errors and bind a
	slime-toplevel catcher.

	* swank-cmucl.lisp:
	(sldb-loop): Flush output at the beginning.
	(inspect-in-frame): New function.
	(frame-locals): Don't send the validity indicator across wire.  Too
	cmucl specific.

2003-10-29  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el (slime-net-sentinel): Only show a message about
	disconnection if the inferior-lisp is still running.
	(slime-interrupt, slime-quit): Only send the quit/interrupt
	message to Lisp if it is in fact evaluating something for us. This
	fixes a protocol bug reported by Paolo Amoroso.  Added (require
	'pp).

2003-10-28  James Bielman  <jamesjb@jamesjb.com>

	* null-swank-impl.lisp: New file.

	* swank-openmcl.lisp: Pre-refactoring updates to the OpenMCL backend:
	(map-backtrace): Renamed from DO-BACKTRACE.
	(frame-source-location-for-emacs): New function.
	(function-source-location-for-emacs): New function,

	* swank-openmcl.lisp: Docstring updates/additions.

2003-10-25  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* Everywhere: Changed the connection setup to use a dynamic
	collision-free TCP port. The new protocol is this:
	
	  Emacs calls (swank:start-server FILENAME) via the
	    listener. FILENAME is /tmp/slime.${emacspid}
	  Lisp starts a TCP server on a dynamic available port and writes
	    the port number it gets to FILENAME.
	  Emacs asynchronously polls for FILENAME's creation. When it
	    exists, Emacs reads the port number, deletes the file, and makes
	    the connection.
	
	The advantage is that you can run multiple Emacsen each with an
	inferior lisp, and the port numbers will never collide and Emacs
	will always connect to the right lisp.

	All backends are updated, but only CMUCL and SBCL are
	tested. Therefore, OpenMCL is almost certainly broken just now.
	
	* slime.el (inferior-slime-closing-return): New command that
	closes all open lists and sends the result to Lisp. Bound to C-RET
	and (for people who use C-m for RET) C-M-m.
	(inferior-slime-indent-line): Improved indentation in the inferior
	list buffer.

2003-10-24  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el (inferior-slime-return): Command bound to RET in
	inferior-slime-mode: only send the current input to Lisp if it is
	a complete expression (or prefix argument is given). Two reasons:
	it makes the input history contain complete expressions, and it
	lets us nicely indent multiple-line inputs. (Thanks Raymond Toy
	for the suggestions.)

2003-10-23  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el (slime-maybe-start-lisp): Restart inferior-lisp if the
	process has died.

	* swank-sbcl.lisp (accept-connection): Use a character stream to
	match swank.lisp.

2003-10-22  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* swank-cmucl.lisp (setup-request-handler): Create a character
	stream.
	(read-next-form): Removed.

	* swank.lisp (read-next-form, send-to-emacs): Assume *emacs-io* is
	a character stream. Add the necessary char-code/code-char
	conversions.

	* slime.el: slime-keys: Add :sldb keywords for keys useful in the
	debugger.
	(slime-init-keymaps): Allow allow :sldb keywords.

	inferior-lisp-mode-hook: Display the inf-lisp buffer if there is
	some output.

	(slime-process-available-input): Start a timer to process any
	remaining input.
	(slime-dispatch-event): The timer should take care of any lost
	input. So don't process the available input here.  Remove the
	process-input argument.
	(slime-push-state, slime-pop-state, slime-activate-state,
	 slime-idle-state, slime-evaluating-state): Update callers.
	(slime-debugging-state): Remove the unwind-protect in the
	:debug-return clause.  Should not be necessary.

	sldb-mode-map: Define more slime-mode keys.

	(slime-time<, slime-time-add): Removed. Emacs-21 has equivalent time
	functions.
	(slime-sync-state-stack): Use Emacs-21 time-date functions.
	(seconds-to-time, time-less-p, time-add): Compatibility defuns.

2003-10-22  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el (slime): With a prefix argument, prompt for the port
	number to use for communication with Lisp. This is remembered for
	future connections.

2003-10-22  Hannu Koivisto  <azure@iki.fi>

	* slime.el (slime-space): Now allows one to insert several spaces
	with a prefix argument.

2003-10-21  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el (slime-space): Don't give an error when not connected,
	to avoid feeping.

	* swank-sbcl.lisp (swank-compile-string): Include only one
	:SOURCE-PATH attribute in the plist, and replace the front element
	with a 0 (fixes a problem probably due to recent hacks to the
	elisp source-path lookups).

	* slime.el (inferior-slime-mode): New minor mode for use with
	`inferior-lisp-mode'. Defines a subset of the `slime-mode' keys
	which don't clash with comint (e.g. doesn't bind M-{p,n}).
	(slime-keys): List of keybinding specifications.
	(slime-find-buffer-package): If we don't find the "(in-package" by
	searching backwards, then try forwards too.

	* swank.lisp (completions): Fixed semantics: should now consider
	only/all completions that would not cause a read-error due to
	symbol visibility. Also avoiding duplicates and sorting on
	symbol-name.

2003-10-20  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* swank.lisp (completions): Slight change of semantics: when a
	prefix-designator is package-qualified, like "swank:", only match
	symbols whose home-package matches the one given - ignore
	inherited symbols.

	* slime.el: Updated test suite to work with the different backends:
	(find-definition): Lookup definitions in swank.lisp.
	(arglist): Lookup arglists of functions in swank.lisp.

2003-10-20  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* slime.el (interactive-eval): Make test case independent of
	*print-case*.

2003-10-20  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* swank-cmucl.lisp (clear-xref-info): Conditionalised
	xref:*who-is-called* and xref:*who-macroexpands* with
	#+CMU19. This makes SLIME compatible with CMUCL 18e, but also
	disables the `who-macroexpands' command in any CMUCL version that
	doesn't have the "19A" feature (which does break the command in
	some snapshot builds that can actually support it).

2003-10-20  Daniel Barlow  <dan@telent.net>

	* swank.lisp (*notes-database*): tyop fix

	* swank-sbcl.lisp (throw-to-toplevel): select TOPLEVEL restart
	instead of throwing to a catch that no longer exists

	* slime.el: change some strings containing 'CMUCL' to more 
        backend-agnostic phrases

2003-10-19  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* slime.el, swank-cmucl.lisp, swank.lisp: First shoot at input
	redirection.

	* swank-sbcl.lisp, swank-openmcl.lisp: Bind *slime-input* and
	*slime-io* to dummy values.

2003-10-19  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el (slime): Connection setup is now asynchronous, with
	retrying on a timer. This makes it possible to bring the server up
	by hand while debugging. `M-x slime' while already connected will
	cause the old connection to be dropped and a new one established.
	(slime-disconnect): New command to disconnect from Swank, or
	cancel asynchronous connection attempts when not yet connected.
	(slime-state/event-panic): Illegal events in the communication
	state machine now trigger a general panic that disconnects from
	Lisp, and displays a message describing what has happened. This is
	a bug situation.
	(slime-connect): Print a message during connection attempts unless
	the minibuffer is active (it's annoying to get messages while
	trying to enter commands).

2003-10-18  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* slime.el: Fix some bugs in the state machine and be a bit more
	careful when processing pending input.
	(slime-compile-region): New command.
	Some more tests.
	
2003-10-17  James Bielman  <jamesjb@jamesjb.com>

	* .cvsignore: Add OpenMCL and SBCL fasl file extensions.

	* swank-openmcl.lisp (who-calls): Fix bug where we would try to
	take the TRUENAME of NIL when source information isn't available
	for a caller.
	(backtrace-for-emacs): Clean up the backtrace code a bit in 
	preparation for implementing FRAME-LOCALS.
	(frame-catch-tags): Implement a stub version of this.
	(frame-locals): Implemented fully for OpenMCL.

	* swank-loader.lisp (compile-files-if-needed-serially): Be a little
	more verbose when compiling files.

2003-10-17  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* swank.lisp, swank-sbcl.lisp, swank-openmcl.lisp,
	swank-cmucl.lisp: Move more stuff to swank.lisp.
	
2003-10-17  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el (slime-post-command-hook): Check that we are connected
	before trying to process input.
	(slime-net-connect): Handle `network-error' condition for XEmacs
	21.5. (Thanks Raymond Toy.)

	* swank-sbcl.lisp: Report style-warnings separately from notes
	(patch from Christophe Rhodes). Use REQUIRE to load sb-introspect
	instead of loading the source file (requires the sb-introspect
	library to be installed, which doesn't yet happen in the
	sourceforge-lagged SBCL anoncvs, but does in the real one).

	* slime.el (slime-style-warning-face): Added style-warnings, which
	are between a warning and a note in severity. (Patch from
	Christophe Rhodes).

	* test.sh: When the test fails to complete, print "crashed"
	instead of reporting nonsense.

2003-10-17  James Bielman  <jamesjb@jamesjb.com>

	* swank.lisp (apropos-symbols): Change back to using the standard
	2-argument APROPOS-LIST and check symbols explicitly when
	EXTERNAL-ONLY is true.
	Move loading of sys-dependent backend code into 'swank-loader'.

	* swank-sbcl.lisp: Moved declarations of *PREVIOUS-COMPILER-CONDITION*
	into 'swank.lisp' to kill warnings about undefined variables.

	* swank-openmcl.lisp (handle-compiler-warning): Use source position
	instead of function name for warning locations.
	(swank-compile-string): Compile into a temporary file instead of
	using COMPILE so finding warning positions works when using C-c C-c.
	(compute-backtrace): Don't display frames without a function.
	(apropos-list-for-emacs): Implement APROPOS.
	(who-calls): Implement WHO-CALLS.
	(completions): Implement COMPLETIONS.
	Use NIL instead of zero so FRESH-LINE does the right thing.

	* slime.el (slime-maybe-compile-swank): Removed function---compile
	the backend using 'swank-loader.lisp' instead.
	(slime-backend): Changed default backend to 'slime-loader'.
	(slime-lisp-binary-extension): Deleted as this is no longer needed.

	* swank-loader.lisp: New file.

2003-10-17  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el (slime-net-connect): Check that
	`set-process-coding-system' is fbound before calling it. This is
	needed in the XEmacs I built from sources.

2003-10-17  Daniel Barlow  <dan@telent.net>

	* swank-sbcl.lisp: Transplanted Helmut's serve-event server to
	replace the existing thread-using server.  SLIME now has no 
	dependency on SB-THREAD

	* slime.el (slime-find-buffer-package): handle errors from (read)
	for the case where the buffer ends before the in-package form does
	(slime-set-package): insert missing comma
	(slime-goto-source-location): sbcl has a disagreement with emacs
	over the meaning of a character position.  Level up with
	C-M-f C-M-b

	* assorted typo fixes

2003-10-16  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el (slime-forward-source-path): Improved somewhat. Seems
	to work for all common cases except backquote. Backquote is
	tricky, because the source-paths are based on the reader's
	expansion, e.g.:
	* (let ((*print-pretty* nil))
	    (print (read-from-string "`(a ,@(b c) d)")))
	  -->
	  (COMMON-LISP::BACKQ-CONS (QUOTE A)
	                           (COMMON-LISP::BACKQ-APPEND (B C)
			                                      (QUOTE (D))))
	Must investigate whether we need to write a hairy
	backquote-traversing state machine or whether this is something
	that could be fixed in CMUCL.

	* swank*.lisp (with-trapping-compiler-notes): This macro is now
	defined here, and expands to a call to the backend-defined
	`call-trapping-compiler-notes' with the body wrapped in a
	lambda. This is to avoid swank.lisp referring to macros in the
	backends -- it gets compiled first so it thinks they're functions.

	* slime.el (slime-swank-connection-retries): New default value is
	`nil', which means unlimited retries (until user aborts). Retry
	interval also reduced from once per second to four times per
	second.

2003-10-16  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* swank-cmucl.lisp, swank.lisp: Fix CMUCL support. 

2003-10-15  Daniel Barlow  <dan@telent.net>

	* swank.lisp: rearrange the backends.  rename swank.lisp to
	swank-cmucl.lisp, then create new swank.lisp which loads an
	appropriate backend according to *features*.  Next up, 
	identify common functions in the backends and move them
	into swank.lisp

2003-10-15  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* slime.el: Inspector support.  list-callers, list-callees
	implemented without xref.

	* swank.lisp: Lisp side for inspector and list-callers,
	list-calees.  Better fdefinition finding for struct-accessors.


2003-10-15  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el (slime-point-moves-p): Macro for executing subforms and
	returning true if they move the point.

	* test.sh: New file to run the test suite in batch-mode. Will need
	a little extending to allow configuring the right variables to
	work with non-CMUCL backends.

	* slime.el: Set `indent-tabs-mode' to nil. This makes diffs look
	better.
	(slime-start-swank-server): Now passing the port number to
	SWANK:START-SERVER.
	(slime-evaluating-state): Debugging synchronous evaluations with
	recursive edits now works.
	(slime-forward-sexp): Added support for #|...|# reader comments.
	(sldb-hook): New hook for entry to the debugger (used for the test
	suite).
	(slime-run-tests): Reworked the testing framework. Now presents
	results in an outline-mode buffer, with only the subtrees
	containing failed tests expanded initially.
	(slime-check): Check-name can now be a string or
	format-control. (Test cases have been updated to take advantage of
	this.)
	(compile-defun): This test case now works for the case containing
	#|..|#
	(async-eval-debugging): New test case for recursively debugging
	asynchronous evaluation.

2003-10-15  Daniel Barlow  <dan@telent.net>

	* README.sbcl: new file

	* README: update for new backends, change of hosting provider

	* swank-sbcl.lisp: new file.
	New SWANK backend for Steel Bank Common Lisp, adapted from
	swank.lisp with bits of swank-openmcl.lisp

2003-10-12  Daniel Barlow  <dan@telent.net>

	* slime.el (sldb-mode-map): add mouse-2 clickability for areas
	in sldb buffers covered by the sldb-default-action property:
	restarts can now be mouse-activated

2003-09-28  James Bielman  <jamesjb@jamesjb.com>

	* swank-openmcl.lisp: New file, a Slime backend for OpenMCL 0.14.x.
	(condition-function-name): Figure out the name of methods correctly
	instead of passing a list to Emacs.

	* slime.el (slime-goto-location): Try to position notes based on
	some (questionable) regex searching if the :FUNCTION-NAME property
	is set.  Used in the OpenMCL backend which does not support source
	paths.

2003-09-29  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el: Fairly major hacking.
	Rewrote the evaluation mechanics: similar design but some macros
	to make it look more like a push-down automaton (which it really
	was!). Debugging Lisp no longer uses recursive edits, partly as a
	side-effect and partly to see if it's better this way.
	Removed the asynchronous-communication test cases that tested
	something we decided not to do.
	(slime-eval-string-async): Give a meaningful error message when
	trying to make a request while already busy.
	(slime-lisp-binary-extension): Uh oh, time to start taking out
	gratuitous CMUCL-isms. This variable renamed from
	`slime-cmucl-binary-extension'.
	(slime-backend): Name of the Lisp backend file, defaulting to
	"swank", but can be set to e.g. "swank-openmcl".

	* swank.lisp: Minor protocol changes to accomodate slime.el's
	changes above.

2003-09-28  Helmut Eller  <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* swank.lisp 
	(getpid, set-package, set-default-directory): New functions.
	(slime-out-misc): Don't send empty strings.
	(*redirect-output*, read-from-emacs): A new switch to turn output
	redirection off. Useful for debugging.
	(interactive-eval, interactive-eval-region, pprint-eval,
	re-evaluate-defvar): Bind *package* to *buffer-package*.
	(with-trapping-compilation-notes): Add a dummy argument for better
	indentation.
	(measure-time-intervall, call-with-compilation-hooks): Measure
	compilation time.
	(frame-locals): Use di::debug-function-debug-variables instead of
	di:ambiguous-debug-variables. Don't access non-valid variables.

	* slime.el
	(slime-display-message-or-view): Delete old multi-line windows.
	(slime-read-package-name): Added an optional initial-value
	argument.  slime-pid: New variable.
	(slime-init-dispatcher): Initialize slime-pid.
	(slime-send-sigint): Use slime-pid instead of inferior-lisp-proc.
	(slime-eval): Accept debug-condition messages.
	(slime-output-buffer): Turn slime-mode on.
	(slime-switch-to-output-buffer): New command.  Bound to C-c C-z.
	(slime-show-note-counts): Display compilation time.
	(slime-untrace-all, slime-set-package, slime-set-default-directory
	slime-sync-package-and-default-directory): New commands.
	(slime-princ-locals): Don't access non-valid variables.  This may
	cause segfaults and severely confuse CMUCL.
	(slime-define-keys): New macro.

2003-09-28  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* swank.lisp (create-swank-server): Bind the listen-socket on the
	loopback interface by default, so that remote machines can't
	connect to the Swank server.

2003-09-27  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* swank.lisp (with-trapping-compilation-notes): New macro for
	bindings the handlers to record compiler notes. Now being used in
	`compile-string', which I had broken when removing the compilation
	hook.

	* slime.el (slime-function-called-at-point): Rewritten to work
	better. Now considers "((foo ..." _not_ to be a function call to
	foo because of the double ('s - this will keep it from misfiring
	in e.g. LET bindings.
	(def-slime-test): All tests now being with (slime-sync). This
	fixes some accidental/bogus test failures.

	* swank.lisp (handle-notification-condition): Rewrote
	compiler-note collection. Now it uses lower-level condition
	handlers instead of c:*compiler-notification-function*. This way
	the error messages are tailored to omit redundant information,
	like the filename and original source text (which are displayed
	and highlighted in Emacs already). Much nicer.
	(sort-contexts-by-source-path): Now sorting xref results by
	lexical source-path order, so that you're always jumping in the
	same direction.
	(*debug-definition-finding*): New variable. You can set this to
	true if you want to be popped into the debugger when M-. fails to
	find a definition (for debugging the
	definition-finding). Otherwise it reports the error to Emacs as a
	message, like "Error: SETQ is a special form."

	* slime.el (slime-fetch-features-list): New command to fetch the
	*FEATURES* list from Lisp and store it away. This is done
	automatically upon connection, but can also be called manually to
	update.
	(slime-forward-reader-conditional): Now does the right things with
	reader-conditionals (#+ and #-) based on the Lisp features.

2003-09-26  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el (sldb-setup): Setting `truncate-lines' to t in the
	debug buffer. I like having the backtrace take strictly one line
	per frame, since otherwise a few ugly arguments (e.g. streams) can
	chew up a lot of space. (Can make this a configurable on request
	if tastes differ :-)

	* swank.lisp: Did a little defensive programming so that asking
	for the definition of an unbound function will return nil to Emacs
	instead of entering the debugger.
	(format-frame-for-emacs): Binding *PRETTY-PRINT* to nil when
	formatting frames (due to truncate-lines change above).

2003-09-24  Helmut Eller <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* swank.lisp:
	Support for stream redirection.
	slime-output-stream: New structure.
	(slime-out-misc): New function.
	*slime-output*: New variable.
	(read-from-emacs): Redirect output to *slime-output*.
	(read-form): Bind *package* inside the standard-io-syntax macro.
	(eval-string): Read the string with read-form.
	(completions): Support for keyword completion.

	* slime.el (slime-process-available-input, slime-eval): Rewritten
	once again.  Don't use unwind-protect anymore. Didn't work
	properly when the Lisp side aborted due to too many debug
	levels. "Continuing" from the Emacs debugger aborts one level on
	the Lisp side. "Quitting" from the Emacs debugger quits the Lisp
	side too. Increase stack sizes before entering the recursive edit.
	(slime-eval-async-state, slime-eval, sldb-state): Support for stream
	output.
	slime-last-output-start: New variable.
	(slime-output-buffer, slime-output-buffer-position,
	 slime-insert-transcript-delimiter, slime-show-last-output,
	 slime-output-string): New functions.
	(slime-show-evaluation-result,
	slime-show-evaluation-result-continuation): Use them.
	(slime-use-inf-lisp-p, slime-insert-transcript-delimiter,
	 slime-inferior-lisp-marker-position,
	 slime-inferior-lisp-show-last-output): Deleted.
	(slime-use-tty-debugger, slime-debugger-hook,
	slime-enter-tty-debugger, slime-tty-debugger-state): Deleted. Removed
	tty debugger support.
	(def-sldb-invoke-restart): Renamed.
	(define-sldb-invoke-restart-key, define-sldb-invoke-restart-keys):
	Version without eval.
	(defun-if-undefined): New macro.
	Many indentation fixes.

2003-09-23  Helmut Eller <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* swank.lisp (completions):
	Moved most of the completion code to Lisp.
	(string-prefix-p): Be case insensitive.

	* slime.el:
	Make sure define-minor-mode is defined before we use it.
	(slime-completing-read-internal, slime-completing-read-symbol-name,
	slime-read-from-minibuffer, slime-completions, slime-complete-symbol):
	Support for reading symbols and expressions with completion.
	(slime-read-symbol-name): New function.
	(slime-read-symbol): Use it.
	(slime-read-package-name): Case insensitive completion.

	(slime-edit-symbol-fdefinition, slime-edit-fdefinition): Rename
	slime-edit-symbol-fdefinition to slime-edit-fdefinition.

2003-09-23  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el (slime-show-xrefs): Improved the xrefs buffer, now
	using a custom minor mode.
	(slime-next-location): This function goes to the next "something"
	by funcall'ing slime-next-location-function. Currently that
	variable is set by xref commands like who-calls to go to the next
	matching reference. In future it can also be used to go to the
	next function definition for a generic-function-understanding
	version of edit-fdefinition. Bound to C-M-. and C-c C-SPC, until
	we see which binding is better.

2003-09-22  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el (slime-symbol-at-point): Now returns a symbol, as the
	name suggests.
	(slime-symbol-name-at-point): This one returns a string.
	(slime-read-symbol): New function for taking the symbol at point,
	or prompting if there isn't one.
	(slime-edit-fdefinition): Now uses looks up the symbol at point,
	not the function being called at point.

	* swank.lisp (who-calls, who-references, who-binds, who-sets,
	who-macroexpands): New function.
	(present-symbol-before-p): Use `*buffer-package*' when checking
	accessibility of symbols.

	* slime.el (slime-restore-window-configuration): New command to
	put the Emacs window configuration back the way it was before
	SLIME last changed it.
	(slime-who-calls, etc): Very basic WHO-{CALLS,..} support. Not
	finished, wrestling around trying to make `view-mode' or
	`help-mode' help me (I just want to hijack RET and C-m). Bound to
	"C-c C-w ...".

2003-09-21  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el: Rearranged the `outline-mode' structure slightly.
	(slime-check-connected): Using new function to give a helpful
	error message if you try to use commands before establishing a
	connection to CMUCL.
	(sldb-mode): Keys 0-9 are now shortcuts to invoke restarts.

	* README, swank.el: Updated commentary.

2003-09-20  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el (slime-choose-overlay-region): Tweaked overlay
	placement.

	* swank.lisp (handle-notification): Skipping null
	notifications. For some reason CMUCL occasionally calls us with
	NIL as each argument.

2003-09-19  Helmut Eller <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>
	
	* slime.el (slime-connect): Propose default values when called
	interactively.
	(slime-process-available-input): If possible, use while rather than
	recursion.
	(slime-compilation-finished-continuation): New function.
	(slime-compile-file, slime-compile-defun): Use it.
	(slime-forward-source-path): Id an error is encounter move back to the
	last valid point.
	(slime-eval-region): Use append COND.  Send the entire string to the
	Lisp side and read&evaluate it there.
	(slime-eval-buffer): New function.
	(sldb-sugar-move, sldb-details-up, sldb-details-down): New functions.
	
	* swank.lisp (interactive-eval-region): New function.
	(re-evaluate-defvar): New function.
	(compile-defun): Install handler for compiler-errors.
	(function-first-code-location): Simplified.
	
2003-09-17  Helmut Eller <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>
	
	* slime.el (slime-apropos-all): New command, bound to C-c M-a.
	(slime-eval): Simplified.
	(swank:arglist-string): Send a string and not a symbol.  It easier
	to package related thins in CL.
	(slime-edit-symbol-fdefinition): Prompt when called with
	prefix-argument.
	(slime-eval-region): New function.
	(slime-load-file): New function.
	(slime-show-description): Set slime minor mode in Help buffer.

	* swank.lisp: (read-string, from-string): Renamed read-string to
	from-string.
	(to-string) New function.
	(arglist-string): Catch reader errors.
	(sldb-loop): Also bind *readstrable*.

	
2003-09-16  Helmut Eller <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* slime.el (slime-toggle-trace-fdefinition): New command.
	(slime-symbol-at-point, slime-sexp-at-point): New utility functions.
	(slime-edit-symbol-fdefinition): Similar to slime-edit-fdefinition but
	uses swank:function-source-location-for-emacs.
	(slime-goto-source-location): New function.
	(sldb-show-source): Use it.
	(slime-read-package-name): Completing read for package names.
	(slime-apropos): Use it.

	* swank.lisp (function-source-location,
	function-source-location-for-emacs): New functions to extract
	source locations from compiled code.  For struct-accessors we try
	to find the source location of the corresponding constructor.
	(list-all-package-names): New function.
	(toggle-trace-fdefinition, tracedp): New functions.

2003-09-15  Helmut Eller <e9626484@stud3.tuwien.ac.at>

	* slime.el: Moved many CL fragments from slime.el to swank.lisp.
	(slime-compile-file, slime-compile-defun, slime-goto-location):
	Compiler notes are now represented with a property list.  To find
	the source expression first move to the file offset of the
	top-level form and then use the source path to find the
	expression.  This should avoid many reader issues.  For
	compile-defun store the start position of the top-level expression
	from the buffer in the compiler notes and use that to locate error
	messages.  Add error overlays for notes without context to the
	first available expression.

	* swank.lisp: Moved many CL fragments from slime.el to swank.lisp.
	(defslimefun): New macro.

2003-09-15  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el (slime-setup-command-hooks): Removed post-command-hook
	that was used for cleaning up input that was unprocessed due to an
	error breaking out of the process filter. This is now handled by
	an `unwind-protect' in the filter.

	* swank.lisp (apropos-list-for-emacs): Hacked the apropos listing
	to accept more options and to specially sort results.

	* slime.el (slime-net-send): Added newlines to messages over the
	wire. This makes the protocol nicely readable in Ethereal.
	(slime-sync): New function for blocking until asynchronous
	requests are complete.
	(slime-apropos): Hacked the apropos command: by default, only
	external symbols are shown. With a prefix argument you have the
	option to include internal symbols and to specify a package.
	(slime-run-tests): Extended the test suite. Use `M-x
	slime-run-tests' to run it.

2003-09-14  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el, swank.lisp: Added the debugger written by Helmut.

	* cmucl-wire.el: Removed. The WIRE communication protocol has been
	replaced by a simple custom TCP protocol based on READ/PRIN1 to
	send sexps as ascii text. This simplifies the code, makes the
	protocol nicely debugable with ethereal, and should ease porting
	to other Lisps. Incremented TCP port number to 4005 in honor of
	the new protocol.
	
	In addition, Lisp now always uses *print-case* of :DOWNCASE when
	preparing sexps for Emacs. This is in reaction to a bug with Emacs
	reading the empty list as `NIL' instead of `nil'.

	* slime.el (slime-net-connect): The Emacs end of the new
	communication protocol.

	* swank.lisp (create-swank-server): The Lisp end of the new
	communication protocol.

2003-09-11  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el (slime-mode): Added Helmut's commands to the mode
	description.
	(slime-show-apropos): Setting `truncate-lines' to t in apropos
	listings, to avoid line-wrapping on overly long descriptions.
	(slime-run-tests): Added the beginnings of an automated test
	suite. (This is most useful for testing cross-Emacsen
	compatibility before releases.)

	* swank.lisp (symbol-external-p): Put back this function which was
	lost in a merge.

2003-09-10  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el, cmucl-wire.el, swank.lisp: Large patch from Helmut
	Eller. Includes: apropos, describe, compile-defun, fully
	asynchronous continuation-based wire interface, interactive
	evaluation, and more. Very nice :-)

2003-09-08  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* cmucl-wire.el (wire-symbol-name, wire-symbol-package): Fixed to
	handle internal references (pkg::name).

	* slime.el (slime-swank-connection-retries): Increased default
	number of connection retries from 5 to ten.

	* swank.lisp (find-fdefinition): Support for finding
	function/macro definitions for Emacs.

	* slime.el: Indentation "cleanups": somehow I was using
	`common-lisp-indent-function' for Emacs Lisp code previously.
	(slime-edit-fdefinition): Added M-. (edit definition) and M-, (pop
	definition stack) commands. Definitions are found in much the same
	way Hemlock does it. The user-interface is not the same as TAGS,
	because I like this one better. We can add TAGS-compatibility as
	an optional feature in future.

2003-09-04  Luke Gorrie  <luke@bluetail.com>

	* slime.el (slime-completions): Now supports completing
	package-internal symbols with "pkg::prefix" syntax.

	* Everything: imported slime-0.2 sources.
